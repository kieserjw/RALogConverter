stupid lady didn't have her dogs fenced in again. the little black piece of crap chased me and i slowed down to keep from tripping over him since i know that he just jumps a lot. this time the big white one who is usually lazy as shit came running out and tried to take a chunk out of my lower leg while i stumbled over the other dog trying to get away. i felt teeth against my leg but managed to slip away and they both returned to their yard, from which a little girl had watched the whole thing. i stopped to check whether i was wounded, but he hadn't managed to break skin. i was planning to hop in the car and drive straight up there when i finished, but when i started running again i checked over my shoulder and saw a lady pulling out of the driveway. she pulled up and started talking to me and i let her know that he bit me but i was okay. then i told her that she would probably want to get a fence because she might not be so lucky next time. probably should have talked to the dogs. they seemed smarter."

been even more ravenous than normal over the last few days, so i've been bringing enough food so that i can sit and eat basically all day at work while i measure wal-mart and lowe's parking lots. today my lunch was 2 pb&j's on cinnamon-raisin bread, an apple, yogurt, carrot sticks, a nature valley granola bar, some blueberries, and a huge burrito (bigger than chipotle) from La Mexicano because i was still hungry. the burrito finally did it for me. i might have to be like bob and log that burrito later"

there was this couple at the soccer field walking around with their dog. seemed perfectly normal at first. as i got closer, i noticed that they were calling for another animal. i guessed that one of their dog's got away. looking around, i noticed that i was wrong. the animals that they were calling for were not dogs, as i had initially thought, but cats. they spent the entire time that i was there getting their cats to follow them from the soccer fields across the street to their house.

race tomorrow. i think it will be slower than my other 2 this summer because dom and i both kind of just feel like taking it easy and then dropping the hammer on the last mile. i'm thinking 5:50, 5:50, 5:20. that would put us mid 17's. with 5:50's that last mile really could end up around 5 flat if we were really racing it, but i doubt it will get that fast."

course was short. they probably measured it in a car, or they heard that 5k was about 3 miles and just said that it was close enough. either way, it was probably around 17 flat 5k pace. i was thrilled for the first minute or 2 when i thought it was 16:16, especially since it didn't feel like much of an effort for that time. i'm fine with a 17-flat though, if i can run it that easily. i'm excited for the season to start now because i feel like i could hit a low 27 8k in a real race situation.

mile splits were 5:23, 5:22, and 5:30, but those probably don't mean anything. in reality, the 2nd mile was probably the slowest, because i felt like i was just holding the first mile pace, and i might hvae been under 5:20 for the last mile. i think the markers were pretty far off. finan said his 2nd mile was around 4:40, so he concurs.

almost forgot the sweetest part of it. for some reason they had a different price for minors and adults, so i got charged 10 bucks instead of the usual 15 since my 18th isn't until monday. chicka chicka yeah."

ran with p2b for most of the run. pretty good run. we wanted to keep the pace a little slower, but we kept running 6:45's, so i guess it's okay as long as it felt easy.

little analysis of the last seven days of training: saturday race, sunday long run, monday 1000's, tuesday easy, wednesday tempo and hills, thurs easy, friday race. 5 out of seven days were hard. wednesday tempo was sub 5:40 pace, so it was pretty close to basically being a race itself. it's not the end of the world that i didn't run great here, since my goal is to run well when it counts, but it just seems like a big waste to go out to a meet like that if you do it in such a way that makes it so most of the team doesn't run well."

So then I needed 7 at night. I ended up getting a call from my aunt asking if I could babysit, and I was being a bum until then, so when I got done babysitting at 11:30 I still had not run. I decided that even though it was midnight by the time i was ready to run, I would go for it anyway (it was a bright night). less than 3 mins in i rolled my ankle on a curb. I don't think it is as bad as I worried that it was, but i decided to turn around because I was within a half mile and I thought that there was a good chance it would be tough to run on when the initial adrenaline wore off. So I'm at around 31 miles for the week now when I would like to be at 37 or 38. I'll definitely get a 12 or 13 in tomorrow, ankle cooperating.

I kicked it off, which I think was the wrong choice. I dropped back 6 or 7 places in the last 3k. I'm sure not having the shoe did hurt me, especially on the gravel section in the woods, but I also feel like I let it take me out of the race a bit. It's almost like I stopped racing until I realized I was in danger of not making all-OAC. Fought well in the last 400 if that's any consolation. really, it was a well-run race, and I need to give myself credit where it's due, look at the areas I need to improve, and place top 35 in the region (all-region). new goals are going up on the wall."

I'm thinking I'll do a 15 on saturday or sunday and a midweek 12, then singles on workout days, and doubles the other 2 days. another highlight from the run was racing a squirrel who was running on the power lines. he dropped out just before I could pass him. what a bitch."

I turned around and sprinted the other way. I didn't want to go a different way home because the shortest alternative would have been over 8 miles. so I stood there and yelled for the owner but it didn't seem like anyone was home. then I saw a pickup truck coming up the road toward me and decided to execute a pick and roll. so I waited until the truck was almost between me and the dogs and took off as fast as I could. the lab stepped into the street for a second and almost got hit by the truck before jumping back into his yard and the little shit ran next to me for a few seconds, but I got away unscathed. 5 or 6 more tonight."

I ended up hitting the track because it was getting late by the time I was done working and that was the closest flat place to run. warmed up 2 counterclockwise in just over 13 mins (feeling pretty good, obviously) then did some drills. did the whole workout clockwise on the track. I got a bit excited starting out and probably took the first couple segments a little too hard. I think I was going somewhere between 5:10 and 5:20 pace. after that my legs felt pretty tired, but I really kept close to the same pace for the workout (low to mid 5:20's on the hard segments and high 7's on the easy ones). the backstretch on the track was a bit windy, making it more difficult. I kind of wanted to do 5 but I decided not to since I've been feeling tired. 

near the end of my workout my left ankle started hurting on the inside, just behind the ankle bone (toward the heel). I started cooling down on bethel-NR road, but flipped early because it was getting dark and cars weren't moving over to avoid hitting me. on the way back my ankle started hurting pretty badly and was getting worse, so I cut the cooldown short. when I took my shoe off I had a bruise in that area. it's hurt there a bit the last week, so I think it might just be shoes. I have a new pair that I wanted to wait for an easy day to break in. otherwise it was just running that much on a track that caused it. off day if I'm not feeling good tomorrow. /long post"

I had to stop and fix my shoes a few times. I always hate new shoes. One of those times I knelt down a few feet from a dead cat. that was a bit nasty. quote of the run was 'didja see any beagles while you was runnin?' I didn't see any beagles, but I did see two red foxes frolicking in a field together.

I ended up counting out 450 full strides (90 strides per minute x 5 mins) and then 90 for the recovery, then just assuming that I was going the same paces for the last 3. 

hammies were still a bit sore from the previous workout and it was snowing and windy the whole time. it felt like the wind was in my face the entire time. the course was slightly uphill or downhill the whole way. few flat sections and no steep hills.

Cool-down: 

grand workout today. order was 8, 4, 16, 4, 8, 5x2. 2-3 min rest between intervals, probably a little more before the 200s, then 30 between 200s. I lead the 3k paced stuff and pat did the 400s and 3 of the 5 200s. the mile was great. I just got on pace and cruised. I was starting to disconnect from reality after the 2nd 400 but managed to keep it on pace, then running some 29 and 30 sec 200s wasn't hard at all. I actually feel less trashed after this workout than I did after 1000s last week. I might go back to flats more often for longer stuff to save my legs a bit.

The main event of the day was perhaps the most grueling and intensely contested. Pat and I ended up being separated by only 1 (20-19), but we had completely different races. Pat got out well and slacked in the middle, while I was a bit slower and really hammered about 7-13. in the end, it was a pure guts race, and Pat's strong finish got him the victory and a provisional qualifier. For me, just a sick PR and 1 off of provo."

I ran a few laps while they were doing drills, then I ran a couple of laps with a few of the guys (almost everyone did drills then a 1 lap warmup since the head coach believes that running slowly makes you slower--a belief that I can confirm through personal experience). I ended up pretty much being coach during the workout. they wanted to take 5 min rest and I convinced them to cut it to 3 (still too long imo). I did the mile repeat with them, thinking I would just run with some of the slower people, but after a lap I decided to catch up to the leader and ended up running in the 5:40's with him. I jogged a bit in the opposite direction while they were doing the first 800, then went out for a loop that ended up being about 4.9. I got either 11 or 12 laps in, so I'm not totally sure on the distance. over a pretty relaxed day. I felt a bit better than the last couple days so tomorrows workout should be nice."

I would have liked to keep the run continuous, but had some issues getting the shoes to feel good, as I usually do on the first run, so I had a couple short stops to adjust. I think I might buy my next pair of shoes when these are only halfway done because I think at least part of the problem is going from a completely broken down shoe to a brand new one. good workout overall. as far as pace, I would guess that I cut it down a bit more than 10 secs/mile for the first few miles, maybe stuck in the high 5:40s for a while, then finished around 5:30.

1600 on track
1 mile tempo on road
1200
1 mile
800
1 mile
400

~2 minute rest on everything. possibly longer on the 400. rest was long enough to put on spikes and take a few seconds to loosen my legs up again.

felt pretty crappy starting out. pat took the lead and I felt like we had gone out in like 66-67 when it was really 71 (right on the money). pat got us through 800 on pace then I took over and sucked. It was cold and windy out so I think it was just hard to gauge pace from effort. we went out a bit hard on the tempo mile (1:15, 1:20 for 2:35), then brought it in with a 2:20. that mile felt pretty chill. 1200 was still a bit off. next tempo mile was 5:18. the slow down on 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 wasn't because I felt like I couldn't run 5:15 on all of them, but because I was getting a better feel for the pace. 800 felt much better than the 16 and 12. last tempo was fine. hit 5:20. made the quick transition into spikes for the 400 and balled out a 58, splitting 29, 29 like a true distance runner. I'm definitely sore and tired, but I'm definitely not feeling totally wrecked by the workout. that's a pretty exciting one though. 1500 this weekend (sunday, eh?) is going to be pretty sweet, but I'm really looking forward to some 5ks and 10ks.

I zigzagged around on the trails between northpark and fairhill for a while, so I don't know exact distance. no time either, but between wind and rocky trails, it was slow.

Kyle told me to get up there so I went with him. hitting 75s and 76s for a while. I was slightly demoralized about 2 miles in when I realized how much I had left, but still feeling pretty relaxed and just rolling along. pace was gradually slowing down (hit a few 77 and maybe a 78) and I was going back and forth between feeling like I was really working to stay with him and feeling like I could speed up and pass him. he didn't leave me much of a choice at around 4 miles by moving into lane 2 and slowing down. I surged on the straightaways 3 times in a row to try and open a gap and keep fyock from catching us, but I really ran my own legs off with those surges so when fyock caught up I couldn't move with him and dickman. I clicking off laps in the 80s (ouch) and around lap 21 I had to chase the thought of dropping out away (idiotic since I was in 3rd with probably somewhere between 50 and 75 meters on 4th). so I would definitely say I unraveled a little bit psychologically. managed to pull myself together to run a pretty good last lap and hold my 3rd place. first all-OAC finish on the track for me. a few things that I wonder about with this race is how fast I could have gone and where I could have finished if I had just been able to sit on dickman. I feel like I'm capable of 31:40s. also whether I should have run more like how fyock did instead of going out with dickman. lastly, if I could have done any better if I had surged for 200-300 instead of 100 on 100 off. I probably just would have wrecked my legs even more, but I might have dropped him and been able to keep running scared. who knows? ready to run a good 5k. my butt hurts."

I didn't go with the first group of guys, but I sat in the 2nd group and still hit the mile in 4:48. I was pretty uncomfortable by the halfway point. tried to move when someone (fyock?) came around us, but just started falling back. schoenlein caught me in the last 100 to put me out of the top 8 but I found a little something to get back in front of him. fairly happy with conference overall. would have hated to have missed scoring in the 5k so I'm pretty happy I hung in there at the end. I'll run a big PR in 2 weeks.

also, it needs to be mentioned that I forgot where the starting line was for this race. I was waiting around by the finishing line until about 3 minutes before the start. haha pretty funny since it all worked out, but I do need to be more careful not to mess up my chances to race with stupid crap like that.

Cross Training Comments:
during the run I found a turtle who was sitting the the middle of the road, so I moved him across. a couple hours later while I was walking the dog I found another one (far enough away that it couldn't have been the same one and I let tigger sniff him then moved him across the road as well. I like turtles."

I thought I would really get moving on the way back, but just took it easy so I only ran a min or so faster. I'm not sure about the distance. I was able to see and map out the trail online, but it didn't feel that slow. maybe it was though. who knows?"
05/26/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,7.20,miles,3300,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"first run at smiley creek. I could definitely tell the difference in my breathing, but it didn't feel bad overall. there were a few inches of snow in some places. I wanted to hit an hour but I gave myself some get lost time that I didn't end up needing and I felt like being done when I got back. that's probably just about the worst run I'll have here and it wasn't bad at all so I'm looking forward to this summer.

I'm just putting in the same amount of time right now as I would at sea level, even if the mileage is lower (so if I need about 8 miles I'll put in 56 mins, even if that's 7-7.5). I still want to have some basic idea of weekly mileage, so I'm just guessing for now. I'm thinking I'll probably double for 70-85 mins tomorrow."

05/27/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1697,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"I busted out dom's old garmin for this one and it seemed to work pretty well. I think the valley I'm in is wide open enough that the mountains don't screw the signal up. the garmin had me starting out in the 7:40s, then hanging out in the 7:20-30 range on the way out. at 1.9 I stopped and did 4 strides that were around 15 secs each with a walk back. I'm guessing the stides brought the pace down a bit. on the way back I was mostly in the 7-7:15 range, until the last half mile where the garmin had me getting down close to 6:40. I'm not so sure about that, but maybe. overall it seems like everything is 20-40 secs slower per mile than it would be at sea level. I'm guessing that on a similar day in cleveland I would have been around 7-flat on the way out and 6:30s at the end.

In other news, the people at the lodge convinced me to run a race tomorrow. There's a thing going on up the road with a 5k, 10k, and half marathon. I was very reluctant since I don't really want to run hard and the entry fee was high (25+10 dollars for late registration), but they pulled some strings since they know people who are running the race and got the fee lowered, so I'm doing the 5k. the race registration actually had runners put in an expected finish time and the only time under 20 is a high school kid who put himself in at 18. I'm going to take it out pretty easy but I'm hoping to just cruise to a high 17-low 18 and call it a tempo."
05/28/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Race,4.75,miles,1500,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"This one was slightly frustrating at first but I ended up having a fun time. I showed up at the course around 8:40 and it was 30 degrees out. got registered then started warming up for the 9:30 start time. after running about 2 miles and putting my flats on I found out that the start time posted online was wrong and it was actually 10:30. so I went and sat around until about 9:45 then started warming up again. this time I only ran a mile or so. 

At the start a kid from a local high school went with me. my goal was to run 5:40 to 6 mins but I think my competitive nature kicked in a bit. he was with me for .75 miles then I asked him if he knew if there were mile markers and he answered with great difficulty then immediately dropped off. I didn't mean to use the show-the-competition-that-you're-not-trying-as-hard-as-they-are tactic, but I think that's what happened. The course was about a 1 mile loop (estimate since there were no markers) back to the starting line then a loop in the other direction (so it passed the finish line at 1 mile). I got out to around 1.5 miles and there was a woman with the race company directing us and she told me to go down to the 5k sign then turn around. there was a place where the 5k and 10k courses split 20 meters down the road, so I went to that then turned, expecting her to tell me I was wrong if the turnaround was down the road. instead she just cheered as I went by. I got to the finishing shoot at about 2 miles, stopped, and asked 'is that it?' They asked if I had missed a turn and I said I guess so then went back out  the way I had gone 1 mile in. I did the whole loop after that dodging people and thinking that the kid behind me had done the right thing. he ended up finishing in just over 26 mins a bit behind me. I think about 6 people followed me.

after the race people were jumping into the lake which they had at 39 degrees on the thermometer, so I hopped in and felt my whole body seize up then jumped out. besides the part where I was in the water it felt pretty good.

they ended up giving me first even though someone who went the right way finished the 5k in 20 mins. fun morning overall. it's probably the only race I'll run this summer besides junior nats. The time seems slightly unrealistic for the distance at 7000 ft, especially when I feel like I could have gone quite a bit harder, but I can't really say for sure. even if it was only 4.5 I'm still pretty happy. I thought about entering this as a tempo but I think it was a bit harder than that.

long post for some silly road race"

I did 4 strides with walkback and drills in the same place I did them on Friday (4 miles in) then ran back. the run back was a lot faster because it's slightly downhill. I was going 7 min pace or so most of the way back, but when I was about a half mile out I looked at my watch and I was sub 6. whoops. I was going down a hill and opening up quite a bit. not bad overall. I wore shorts for the first time since I left boise, although i still wore long sleeves. in the afternoon it almost hit 60, but it was cloudy and windy.

work was slow today. not many people coming in yet since it's still too cold for anyone to want to be here. I stayed over to finish a table of really nice older people who had really complicated orders who ended up tipping 10 percent despite stellar service and seeming completely satisfied.

I went out trying to find a path I had done before and ended up just running around somewhere I hadn't been yet. about 2 miles in I went past a big pile, fresh (still steaming) pile of cougar poop. it looks like house cat poop, except bigger and full of fur, if anyone wondered. so I stopped and took a look around to see if I could find the animal. I didn't see it, but I was a bit freaked out since I knew it was really close and probably had already heard or smelled, if not seen me. so I went out another mile or so and then the path dead ended into a small lake. I didn't really want to go back the same way (partially because I didn't want to get eaten) so I walked down a hill toward the river since I thought there might be a trail along it and that it would get me back. the hill was covered in snow, some of which was around 2 feet deep (about up to my knee). 

I got the the bottom and didn't see a trail, so I decided I would walk down the river for a minute to see if there was any path, and I stepped into a snow drift, thinking it was a few inches deep, and I sunk in up to my knee. I took another step and sunk in up to my waist. I struggled to get out for a couple of seconds before realizing what had happened. there was a little stream coming off the river and I had broken through the ice on top. I managed to sort of fall forward into the snow and crawl out, but my shoes were soaked and my hands were numb. my tights were wet all the way up to my knee, too. I ran straight back but felt good enough to add on."

I wandered around for a while and found this place I had been to before but failed to get to on a subsequent attempt. Of course, I found deep philosophical meaning in this: if you ant to find something, stop looking. I hit a bunch of dead ends and did a bit of walking to cut through the woods. I ended up back on the road that I usually run on (smiley creek) but I found another road that lead up to an old abandoned house that only has a wood burning stove and a bed frame inside. I think I might move in. On the way back I felt like letting loose a bit so I hit around 6 min pace for the last 1.5. felt pretty good doing it.

I was feeling pretty decent at first on the way back, but somewhere around 11 I started feeling pretty worn down. I was having a bit of trouble dragging myself up the hills. when I stopped to grab my shirt it took me a few minutes to wind myself up enough to run the last mile (including one last uphill). still, not a bad long run at all.

I think the water probably comes out cold enough that I don't even need any ice.

As for today, I felt tired overall, but my legs weren't too wrecked. I took a new route that was really cool, but also hillier than most of my routes. I'll double tomorrow to hit 65.

I wasn't sure how well she would hold up to 4 miles of running, so I did a loop then dropped her off. she ran really well but seemed to be getting tired by the end. the loop turned out to be 2.1, which just so happens to be exactly half of 4.2, which, coincidentally enough, was the exact number of miles I needed to hit 10 on the day. running with the leash in my hand was a bit awkward feeling, but overall I felt like I was back on my running swag this evening."

80 miles and 40 hours of being on my feet at work this week. My legs still aren't feeling bad. I'm hoping this means I'll feel incredible at sea level and with less time on my feet in a few weeks.

Also, I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing as far as training for the next three weeks. I increased mileage by around 5 every week in July (even though the first few weeks were just getting back to what I had already done in June) and my most recent off day was June 20th, so I'm considering a down week/off day, but I still don't feel like I need one.

I went to the restaurant and a few other places hoping someone just decided that they thought I had lost that stuff and turned it in, but had no luck. at that point I was pissed off and thought I would have to re-warmup, so I decided to do some easy running and do the workout tomorrow when I'll be more capable of making it a good one.

The loop I was using is a triangle where each side is about .35 miles. the grade is similar to the 700s course. first side is flat, 2nd is slightly up, and 3rd is slightly down. 

I found the correct effort pretty easily. I don't have times for all of them, but 1 was 5:41, 4 was low 5:40s, and 5 was around 5:30. rest was 60-70 secs at a walk/very slow jog. I didn't mean to finish quite so fast, but I guess that's not a bad thing since it shows I wasn't struggling to keep the pace.

It was mostly the outside of my right shin on sunday, and on monday that was a bit better but the inside of my right ankle was hurting. Those both felt quite a bit better today by my right calf was incredibly tight starting out. probably a bit of a knot from walking or running slightly differently yesterday. it worked inself out and all I have now is some minor discomfrot in my shin and ankle. I've been icing like betty crocker.

ON TO THE WORKOUT

we started out a bit fast for my liking (sub 5 pace) and my legs were pretty shot after the first few, but I hung in their feeling pretty decent aerobically somewhere in the 5:15-20 range for most of it. I started to fall asleep on the final 3 min interval and let pat gap me by a few steps around a min in but I managed to wake up and finish well. Good job, Jake. Way to not suck. that will totally be going in my success log. cooled down back to Lansdale. Not my best day but definitely a solid workout."

I was planning to sit on the group of mount guys for a while when I caught them, but it felt slow, so I went around them and ran another mid to high 5:20. closed in a 5:07 1555m (5:15-17 mile pace). felt really good through 4.5. still not hurting after that. picking it up to finish next to will was pretty easy. I'd rate the effort at around 90 percent. highlight of the race was kyle telling us to 'link up' at the end, then banton telling us we weren't allowed to do that. kyle claims he didn't say that, but he definitely did.

Got the win as a team, and that felt good. will took 2, I took 3, and chuck took 5 in the race, but 1 and 4 were unattached, so it ended up being 1-2-3. can't wait to see what we run with some interval work in around 50 days."

I never really worked to close the gap and lost them eventually and just ran by myself. felt decent enough.

stepped on the scale when I got back and I was at 139. Last time I was in the 130s I was probably like 10 years old. definitely don't want to be any lighter, but it would be nice if I could keep it around 140."

got out exactly how I wanted to and stayed pretty much on pace. the plan was to run 5:10 pace for basically the first half of the race then start picking people off, and it obviously worked pretty well. I've never run a race this even in cross country, and I think that really helped.  I must have run a pretty slow 4-4.5 (2:40ish, probs) because I was passing jokers like crazy in the last half mile.

switched into flats and got going on 1000s. didn't really know the course on the first one and went on the wrong side of the mulch pile. wasn't really any longer but running around trying to figure the course out slowed it down a little. stayed 2:56-7 for the next 3. felt comfortable. not sure what I was on but I need to figure it out and take it more often.

took it out easy in 3:07. felt good going sub 3 for the next 2, then I gradually started feeling worse and worse until I was pretty light-headed and out of it for the last couple. times dropped off throughout the workout (something like 2:58, 59, 3:00, 3:03, 3:06). still a decent workout and a good job hanging in there despite not being at my best. 

realized after the workout that I had absolutely nothing to eat after I had a sandwich at 11:30, so the fact that I hadn't eaten in 5 hrs at that point was probably the cause. basically the same feeling I've had in the past (most recently at kent during indoor) when I haven't eaten anything for hours before a race to keep from having stomach problems. It seems strange to be since muscle glycogen should last longer than, for example, the 30-40 minutes I had been active today (including warmup and jogs) when I started feeling bad. more likely something to do with brain glucose. doesn't really matter since I know how to keep it from happening, but I would still like to know why.

race recap first:

out in 5 mins right where I wanted to be, chilling on the main pack. everything stayed packed up until around 2 when gogle started picking it up and a few guys went (kenny, caleb, and maybe clemence). I sat back because it was more important to me to compete with the pack of onu guys around me than to stay with those guys. hung in there with that pack for the first lap. somewhere between 5k and 6k I started having a bit of trouble. luckily, woj caught up and got me going. I knew that since woj was obviously on one and chuck was close behind based on hearing people cheer I had to hang in there to give us a chance. hung with woj for the next lap and passed a guy or 2. not really sure what happened at 7k. I must have been gapped a little bit at some point in there. just before the bridge I made a fairly aggressive move in an attempt to set myself up to kick since I didn't want to be left in the situation I had been in the last few times out where I'm closing on someone but have too much distance to make up. maintained up the hill then struggled for the last 200 meters. really feel like I gave it all I had, but couldn't get my legs going. I think I was swearing out loud. pissed that I got passed. didn't end up mattering but I would have a really hard time letting it go if it had.

I couldn't be (much) more proud of how chuck and (especially) woj ran. those guys showed up and gave us a chance at doing what we had come to do. I'm disappointed in finishing 10th, but, at the same time, this race showed 3rd place is right there. 7 second gap. I wasn't feeling great on saturday, so it's exciting to know that I can get up there if I get my shit together."

two-chick ted got a late start, so I helped him finish up his workout. wanted to let him do his thing rather than force him to run too hard, so I just ran next to him in lane 2. 17 was immediately after the 62 off of approx normal rest. sat out 2, including 1 with set rest, for a total of around 6 mins off, then hit one last one. 72 for both of those. off that much rest, the last one felt like a long strider. would have alternated on and off for a couple more to keep him company, but kyle thought I should call it. probably a good call since that's quite a bit of counter-cockwise running (over 5 miles including recoveries). workout wasn't that extreme though. only thing bugging me right now is my right ankle which is still swollen."

I got out pretty well and stayed out of trouble for the first couple of minutes of the race. coming up on the gate where you turn right at the end of the straightaway, I realized that I was in really bad position for the turn with a guy to my right who could push me into the post, so I gave him a gentle push at hip level, and he just dropped his shoulder and sent me right into the fence. I hit it with my shoulder and did a 360, shouted a profanity, and then kept running. Woj went past me during the incident and I tried to start running with him, but I was too shaken up. I did a good job focusing and racing during some portions of the race, all things considered, but I let the shoulder pain and self-pity over having that happen at my last regional meet take me out of the race during other parts. Obviously I'm pretty unhappy with finishing in the 60s.

Incredibly proud of the team though. Woj, Pat, and Will all had their best races of the season. Chuck's was very good, as well. OAC rematch champs, I guess.

I've definitely become a better racer this season. I think that the Jake Smith who ran last year might have let that race turn into a shit show after colliding with a solid object. I still hung in there to some extent and helped my team.

As sad as it makes me that it's over and I feel like I have unfinished business, I'm really proud to have been part of the best team ever to have run at JCU. I'm hoping this is the first in a string of many best teams in JCU history."

01/06/2012,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,12.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"today was my first fairly hard session of the season. I wanted to do 2 x 3 mile tempo. warmed up almost 3, did a few striders and drills then got into it. I was doing it on a 5 mile bike path that was marked off every half mile (I couldn't find a couple of markers if they were there). went out a bit too hard (2:35) then settled down. It started on a long straightaway and the wind was blowing pretty hard in my face, so I overcompensated a bit for that. first mile was 5:17. 7:59 at the halfway point. missed the 2 mile split, and finished in 16:03. right on target. going out too fast made it harder than it should have been.

I decided I would take 5 min rest instead of a half mile jog like I had planned. jogged about a quarter mile to a nearby water fountain and back during the rest.

didn't pick a good place on the path to start the second one since it was entirely uphill and into the wind and missing the half mile mark. hit one mile in a high 5:30. legs were feeling pretty dead. fought the wind for the next mile but ran about the same or a little slower. I was feeling pretty dead, so I called it there rather than pushing through.

not thrilled with the workout since I never like to cut it short, but it was okay for my first time running hard in 2 months. my next couple workouts will get much better now that I've gotten through the first one of the year. I might break it down even further next time I'm doing a workout coming off of down/base time. 5x1 mile w/ 60 sec rest was pretty good before xc. 3 x 2 mile might have been a bit better than 2x3.

cooled down about 4 miles. when I stopped to pick up my shirt, a woman I had passed a few times told me I was a machine. at least I'm still hot. that's all that really matters. anything else is just an added bonus."

stomach didn't feel great and hamstrings were tight starting out. hamstrings got better but stomach really didn't. thought I might be lost from 10-13 or so since I was running on roads I'd never run or even driven but I was okay with it since I was in a groove. thought I might not mind running 20 today. I wasn't able to avoid the german shepherd house. they were on the opposite side of the road and 200 meters earlier than usual. they were far enough back that I just decided to break for it. one came within 10 meters of me but I got away. pickup didn't actually feel bad today. definitely wasn't all out like it's been other times. hopefully my practice running away from dogs will translate into running away from opponents.

felt decent overall. legs didn't feel great, especially during the tempo. hamstrings are kind of tight. could also have been old shoes or the fact that my tights/compression shorts combo was a bit too constricting on my upper legs than I would like for fast running. 200s didn't feel bad, but I need to get used to my spikes again.

I never saw him, but I could hear from the yelling that someone was coming for me.found another gear in the last 100 and got the win by like .2 secs. split was only 4:29, so it wouldn't be great if I hadn't been leading the whole time and defended the win in the end.

3k: pat got out in the lead and I got boxed in. got around those guys during lap 2 and tucked in behind pat until 800 m. took us through the mile in the lead, then will took over. he was in the lead for 3 laps before pat went around him. I started to go with pat but he pulled away. will went back around me and I knew my time wasn't going to be 9:0x and didn't really care about catching will so I kind of went into cruise control. unfortunately other people were still racing and I got caught by an ONU guy with about 20 meters to go. didn't even know he was there until he went around me, so he was going too much faster than me for me to get him before the line. stupid mistake. good place to make it if it had to happen, though."

I kept sliding in then getting stuck behind someone who would slow down and having to move out. trying not to cut woj off didn't make the task any easier. I'm sure some of the runners around me weren't too happy about how all-over-the-place I was. still hit pretty much all 36s and 37s after that first lap.

moved up for most of the race and get in position in front of the group I was with about 30 meters back from will and the OWU guy who was sitting on him. probably ran about the same pace that he did for the last mile, but just wasn't able to close the gap. cramped up in the last 1000, and I wouldn't be surprised if I had a few slightly slower splits. made up for them with a decent last 200. wasn't sure how close the guy behind me was, but I opened up a pretty good (5 sec) gap. running that well after a mile makes me feel pretty good about my strength right now. I also feel like my finish is coming together. I wouldn't be surprised if the mile cost me a bit in the last 1000 when I was cramping up, probably due to fatigue (same place I had cramped on my mile cooldown). also could have run faster if I had been able to run inside the whole time. also getting in better shape every week. pile on the reasons and I'll be sub 15 in no time."

did a new route similar to my last LR at home in January. felt pretty good for the first hour or so. the big hill on 10-mile was a bit easier than yesterday, probably since I focused more on relaxing and 'floating' up rather than trying to power through it. ran with gum for the first hour or so. got to have good breath in case I see any XC girls. mentos gum kind of sucks, btw. they should stick to that diet coke thing. took a quick stop at the (only) gas station in lindale to p00p and get a drink of water. should have brought a couple bucks for some mid-run sugar and so I wasn't a dick who uses the restroom at a gas station owned by the only indian guy in a clermont county then peaces. felt rejuvenated after the stop. 

chestnut sucked, as always. it doesn't really  help that I spend the whole run thinking about how bad it is going to suck. hit it just after mile 10, then took it easy to recover until I hit 132. started progressing with almost exactly 10k to go. actually, going completely on feel it felt like I just clicked off a few miles in the 6:30s then hit a low 6 for mile 16 on the way down pond run. backed it off a bit for the last mile. 

felt strong all the way to the end, which is an accomplishment on a 2 hour run since I end up with something hurting or just feeling like death for the last couple miles a lot of the time. took an ice bath (minus the ice) after. also did a few drills (after the run but before the ice bath)"

I wanted to switch directions for at least one, but there was a guy doing 400s, so I was stuck going counterclockwise.

first one was pretty solid. 2:33, 5:05, and closed in a 75 to hit my time (10:08). I don't think the wind was as bad for this one. there didn't seem to be any really hard gusts, but it might have just been that I wasn't tired yet. felt decent during the 4 min rest. not too out of breath or heavy in the legs. jogged 200. 

got off on pace, then clicked off 77s on the second one (5:07 at the mile). the wind felt much worse. got blown out into lane 2 by a gust at one point. didn't jog as much during the rest segment because my legs were pretty heavy. tried some polk butt kickers to wake them up.

felt okay for the first half of the last one. can't remember my mile, but it must have been around 5:10. I have a habit of lowering my head and trying to sort of plow through the wind, which I think kind of kills my relaxed form. just wanted this one to be over. found it hard to keep going all the way through.

jogged for a few minutes barefoot in the grass as soon as I finished, then put shoes on and did the remainder of 16:30 on the tree loop at the park. jogged the flat and downhill sections and stopped my watch to walk up the hills. slightly unorthodox, but made for a chill cooldown. legs were really tired, so I needed it.

thoughts on the workout: definitely could have hit 10:08s running with people and without wind. not too disappointed that I didn't hit that time for all of them today, since I would have probably needed to be in like 31-flat shape to do that (<--completely arbitrary='' number='' with='' no='' real='' basis).='' this='' race='' got='' me='' excited='' for='' the='' 10k='' at='' wake='' though.='' last='' time='' i='' ran='' one,='' 25='' laps='' on='' the='' track='' seemed='' really='' daunting,='' but='' not='' so='' much=''></--completely>

race was quite disappointing. took it out in second behind a guy from OU. pace was slightly slower than my goal, so after 2k or so I decided to take over and pick the pace up a little. lead for a couple laps then the OU guy went back around me. still sat on him until somewhere around 5k. 9:30 @ 3k, 15:50 @ 5k. at some point probably between 5k and 6k, I'm not sure if he picked it up a little or if I just hit the wall, but I couldn't hang on anymore. started having trouble catching people I was lapping. lapped Jeff and he passed me back at one point. basically just struggled to finish for the second half of the race.

assuming this race was due to some combo of high mileage/intensity and low sleep leading up to this race.

7 pm workout since this one was tough enough without the heat. started with a 1600 on the track. started a little bit off pat, but then decided after the first lap to pick it up and tuck in behind him. didn't feel great on that repeat. the first road mile was a reminder about how easy it is to go too fast. went through 400 right on pace, but we couldn't find the 8 or 12 markers and overcompensated a bit, expecting to need to increase effort to stay on pace.

pat took the 1200 out then I led the last 2 laps. that was probably the hardest part for me since I had some trouble getting around him and then had to focus on not slowing the pace down once I got up there. next road mile was much more relaxed at 5:19

I led the first lap of the 800. went 68/68. road mile in 5:19

changed into spikes and pat did a 400 while I did a 1600. split 70/71/71/66 for 4:37 (doesn't quite add up because of the fractions of seconds). felt silky smooth for the first 1000. kyle jumped in to run the last lap with me. picked it up a bit on the backstretch, then I must have dropped a pretty fast last 200. Kyle has been emphasizing arm carriage recently, so I've been really aware of it, and I was definitely consciously making sure to go through the full range of motion throughout the workout, especially at the end of the intervals. I've also been trying to emulate bernard lagat. I'm getting closer. I mostly just need to work on the face at this point.

I was ready to go any time after 3k, but stayed patient. 

with 3 laps to go, a guy from case started moving around caleb and I went around as well and took the inside on the turn. I didn't want to take the lead yet so I gave him an ever-so-gentle push in the back to move him to the front. the pace might have slightly picked up, because I glance behind on the backstretch and we had a few steps on everyone else, so I used that as my chance to move (just over 1k to go).

took off pretty hard. felt really smooth. looked back after 200 and saw that nobody had gone with me. 64 sec lap. 68 sec next lap. started hurting then and only hit a 36-7 last 200. won by 10 secs.

walked and jogged over to the start of the tempo. quite a bit of rest.

walked back to the track (quite a bit of rest again) then did a mile at 5k pace. I was supposed to go 4:44-4:48 (14:50s pace). went 70-71-71-65 for 4:37. same time I ran to finish my michigan, except this one was in flats instead of spikes and felt a lot easier. the last lap was a steady push instead of a really hard kick like I made during my michigan. not a killer workout but I'm definitely starting to sharpen up at the right time"

This time I really didn't think about the race at all and just enjoyed myself. stuck with the 35 min out 15 min jog today for the warmup as I plan to continue doing. less sedentary time to tighten up physically and stress about the race. I've felt great for the last 2 races so keeping that up.

got off the line well and then settled to my goal pace pretty quickly. Kyle and most of the ONU guys (the race was pretty much JCU, ONU, + a couple randos) got out in front of me. I ended up right behind JC in around 10th. pace was fine. 32.x at 200 and 49 at 300. pace started slowing down where we were in the pack and I was about to go wide but JC opened some space and I followed him through.

gradually worked my way around on the outside and moved up over the next lap. got to run on the rail for a lot of the race. at some point Pat was going around an ONU runner on the outside and I he left enough space for me to take the inside at the same time. kyle took the lead some time around the bell and I was sitting behind. pace definitely picked up. kyle let me pass him on the inside to take the lead going into the turn. I kicked hard and thought I might be clear of the guy from kenyon, but he went around me coming off the turn. pushed all the way through and he stopped gaining ground on me with about 50m to go, but I couldn't close the gap. vadim says we were at 3-flat at 1100, which would mean the last lap was a 63.

not mad about not getting the win today. actually pretty happy about my ability to run a respectable 1500 despite training for the 10k. my main goal was to beat that 4:06 demon that had been over my head since May 2010. ready to roll next weekend.

I was hoping the pace would be slow, just because I didn't want my legs to be trashed for the 5k tomorrow.

I pretty much just stayed as close to 2nd as I could the whole time without doing much outside running. I had been thinking I would go w/ around 900 meters left, and that plan seemed good when I got there. took a glance back and took off. those 2 laps sucked pretty bad. very happy coming down the homestretch to see kyle telling me I could coast in.

executed well today. could have conserved a little bit more if I hadn't been quite so eager to respond to some early moves. used more energy than I needed to when I covered moves from 2k-5k out. need to remember that at those points in the race my response can be a bit more gradual since running a couple 77s will use less energy than a 75 followed by an 80. didn't arrive at the final laps with as much spring as I did at all-ohio in the 5k, but I guess 5.7ish miles of running in spikes will do that to you. feel like I have a good 5k in my legs tomorrow"

I just tried to stay in the 2-3 spots with pat. stuck in there for a while until muller made his move. got some seperation after that. I think me, pat, smith, and maybe simmons might have been the only ones who covered the original move. I stayed there for as long as I could, but then things started going backwards. the last mile was just back and forth with simmons in the 4/5 spots. I think ellis went around with 500 to go and carroll flew by at the bell. pulled away from simmons in the last 200 and and saw jushturbo next to me on the turn. held him off and pulled way a little, then he poured it on in the last 50 and got me. not too disappointed with the race. happy with the weekend. 1st and 7th vs 3rd and 8th last year. it's not over yet."

4-6 800s. went out slow on the first one (35) and overcompensated (31). found the pace after that. 67, 67, 68. kept pretty strict 1 min rest. debated whether I should do another. decided I would take slightly longer rest to make sure I ended on a high note and do it. didn't try to kick it in hard and ran 66.

not a bad workout. considering that it was 90 degrees out, I'm just happy with hitting my times and not crashing. didn't have to work too hard on the tempo even though it seems like my body naturally compensated for the heat by running a bit slower for miles 2 and 3 than I otherwise would have. 400s didn't feel as easy as that pace sometimes does. these final workouts are just about maintaining my current fitness and staying sharp, and today was a solid effort"

in the zone right away. the 1600 was almost perfectly even. the worst I felt during the workout was probably around the halfway point of that interval, but it wasn't too bad. felt smooth.

800s were pretty easy. I think I split 69/72 on both of them

first 2 800s were 68s. got more pumped as I went. 66 on the 3rd one even though the wind was starting a little bit. told kyle I was going to pick it up when I came off the curve on the last one, and I split 33/29.

felt good to knock out such a solid workout solo. I needed this to get me confident and back into the idea of racing for a couple more weeks. rewarded myself with a 4 mile cooldown."

I jumped right up and got back in it. I got Johnny and Ted to run with me for the next mile or so and we moved up through the pack. got into a bad funk during the muddy section. tried to catch grogan in the woods at the end but didn't quite have it.

started out between the pat, pat, and will group and the johnny/ted group. ran the next 2 with johnny and ted. needed a little extra rest to keep the last one respectable, so I dropped back to the woj group.

not a bad start. If I can sustain this, I'll be back in shape in no time. planning on hitting mastick tomorrow and then probably taking thursday off. IT band didn't hurt at all during the workout, but it was slightly sore after."

still got out the door after for my run and it didn't really bug me. planning on going out 50 mins then flipping but I was about to pass a horse at 49, so I just turned there. came back in 47:30. added on a minute and a quarter mile for my running with the boys"

still deciding on the number when I started. started out a bit too hard. first was 1:55. after that they were all 2:03 plus or minus a second. took the jog down very easy and it was around 2:30 every time. stood for around 10 secs at the bottom then started again. decided after a few that if I did 6 good ones I would make my 7th just the top section.

In the future I'll probably go a bit further at the top. I was ending at the 'bikes share the road' sign 10-15 meters after it levels off. I'll take it up closer to the stop sign next time to make it an even 600 and open my stride up for a bit longer

Nothing wsa hurting at all on the run. A bit of overall fatigue. I checked my pace at the first couple half mile markers, but splits were a bit slow so I just went on effort.

I've been assuming I'm in the 67-68 vdot range right now, so I used that as my pace range. Ended up smack dab in the middle at both I and R pace (3:04 and 67.5). I want to go sub-8:50 in the 3k in around a week and half and that looks pretty realistic, especially if I take it easy for a couple of days before.

1000s with 2 min rest were challenging, but I was able to stay relaxed and hit my paces. It definitely would have been nice to have someone to run behind for part of the workout. Ran these in flats then changed into spikes. I had a bit of a friction hot spot on the ball of my left foot at the base of my big toe. I put a little vasoline on it when I switched into spikes, but it still hurt a bit on the turns. I guess the tight turns make my forefoot move around in the shoe.

Took full recovery between 1000s and 400s while I changed shoes. had a quick convo with Joe. 400s at this pace with 3 min rest were pretty easy, as they were meant to be. I felt ready to go after 2 mins, but gave it the full time. The hardest part was just how long this part of the workout took. Almost 22 mins to run 2400 meters.

The ice from this morning was gone and it wasn't raining so I decided to go rather than taking my chances with rain tomorrow. The downside was that I couldn't start until 5:30 so it was really dark by the end. Warmed up 2 miles, ran a couple striders, then started.

Workout was 20 on, 4 off, 15 on, 3 off, 5:20 on. There was supposed to be a 10, but I dropped it because it was too dark and the quality was good on everything else.

Plenty of 5:20 miles in there. Slowest miles were 5:26 and those were when I forced myself to slow down. I thought at the beginning that I would need to start in the 5:30s and work down, but that obviously wasn't necessary. Relaxed the whole time and ended feeling like I could do quite a bit more.

Might have fallen off slightly in the second half (a second or 2 at most) and then made it up in the last 400. Proud of my focus, overall. I'm sure I could have taken a few second off with someone else leading part of the race and more motivation to dig deep and make myself hurt in the final laps.

It was one of the better treadmill runs I've had. It took about 25 minutes for me to want to stop. followed it up with 6 x 15 secs @ 5 min pace and 9% grade. I threw on flats for those. They felt pretty fast without feeling like I was going to fall off. According to the chart I looked at after, that's sub 3:50 effort, but I think the incline reduces the impact enough to make it feel easier for such a short time. Cooled down 1 mile and then did some supplemental stuff.

And now a poem:

Singlet on the treadmill

I was content with letting the pace be a little slower if necessary because I was running the workout mostly on a thin layer of compacted snow, and I figured that plus the extra clothing I was wearing since it was 20 degrees out would add a few secs per mile.

Settled into high 5:30s pace from the beginning, and stayed there throughout the workout. Almost went down on ice just after 3 and I was really cautious after that, including on the turnaround at 3.5 where I jogged to a stop before turning. Just before 5 I got a really bad cramp and tried to stop and start again to get rid of it, but it wouldn't go away. After a couple of tries, I gave up on it and jogged in. It might have been an oblique strain from slipping 10 minutes before, but I've done that before and jogging was more painful after. Ended up with 5 miles at 5:37 average.

This workout didn't take much out of me, so I'm going to deviate from the schedule since 3 days of recovery before my next workout will be completely unnecessary. I'll either do a treadmill workout tomorrow or bump my Sat workout to Thursday and then rearrange from there."

Somewhat tired starting out, but not as bad as the last couple days. Probably took me a few minutes to get going on the first tempo. I ran on the roads for all the hard stuff because the bike path was really icy. I was able to time a half mile late in the second 10 min segment, and it was a 2:43, so I would guess I averaged 5:30 pace or so, which I'm perfectly fine with on this sort of workout right now. 1 hr easy was a bit of a shuffle for the first half. ran out to cedar point rd then stopped for a drink at the nature center. on the way back I timed a couple of 6:45-50 miles, but that's the fastest I went.  15 min tempo was probably a bit slow. It felt easy aerobically, but my tired legs wouldn't go much faster. My left hamstring is a bit beaten up right now."

I rolled it out before bed and the inflammation was completely gone when I woke up. That was a big relief because I was starting to think that I would need to see someone about it and take a few really easy or off days.

Valley miles started at 6:45 and got down under 6:40. Ran the 8.6 loop then stopped by the house, changed into flats, and grabbed Sam for striders. I was giving him a big headstart and then we raced to the fire hydrant. I took them a bit easier than normal. Felt like around mile pace instead of sub 800 pace like they often are"

At one point early on I thought I was in last place in the heat, so I checked, and there was a big gap between me and another small pack, so I decided I was committed. Early on I was just counting how many seconds I had in the bank if I was going to run 15:15, but around 2k I realized that I was going to be way under unless I crashed hard.

The treadmills go to 15 mph, so they're pretty good. Built up for the first couple minutes from 5:40 something pace to 5:33 @ 1.5% grade to compensate for the lack of wind resistance. from 10-20 mins and 30-40 I traded some pace for grade, going to 6 min pace at 4%, which is equivalent effort. I figured that would make it less monotonous and change what muscles I'm working slightly. There was a girl on the elliptical for the first 20 mins, and I waited until she left to go full creature (shirt off and pouring water on my head). The machines were really close together, so I might have scared her off by sweating on her. With 5 mins to go I bumped the emergency shutoff while getting a drink, and then I gradually slowed the pace down for the last 5, finishing with a min at 6 min pace. I logged as if the 6 min pace at 4% was 5:33 pace since the effort is the same.

The streak LTs rubbed the top of my 2nd toes today. I need Vaseline or a mole skin donut next time.

---------
Workout was 4 miles up, 40 mins at M, 5 at T, 30 at M, 5 at T, 2 miles down. My M pace from the Daniels charts (5:32) isn't realistic right now, so I just wanted 5:50 for the 40 and 5:40 for the 30. Felt terrible starting out. Almost called it quits after feeling like crap for 3 miles in 17:40. Relaxed and stopped looking at ever split after that, and I started running better. Finished the 40 at the doors of the nature center and stopped to take a drink and my gu. I'm going to start stashing water at the 6 or 7 mile mark. 1 min jog to the bike path including some drills, then into the 5 at T.

2nd half of the workout was much better. No split for the 5 at T, but the mile including the last 2:30 at T and 2 mins at M was a 5:30, so I must have been going 5:15-20. M pace was 5:40-45 after that. I might start switching these workouts around and starting with a half mile to mile at T, because I always feel better after that. Last 5 at T weren't particularly fast.

Decent workout overall. I think this is only my 2nd time running over 20 at once. Getting closer to running my M pace work at M pace, and that's one of the big goals right now. I think I'm going to do my last few of this type of workout coming off down weeks as Daniels recommends, because they are really hard at the end of a high mileage week."

Frustrated with myself because I noticed on my run last night that I really wasn't feeling recovered yet, so I should have bumped the workout to Thurs. Not sure if this was it, but I had the classic low blood sugar feeling today. Light headed and weak, and then I was really irritable but felt a lot better as soon as I ate something. In either case, I learned a few lessons today. Take the extra easy day when I need it and make sure I eat enough before the evening workout. I counted 1200-1500 kcal before I started at 5, and I hadn't eaten for 4 hrs.

Also realized I haven't had a true down week in a month. 5k week had a couple easy days but wasn't really down. So I'll probably push through the end of this week then go down with an off day next week."

Yesterday was essentially a recovery day, so I decided to get some quality in today. I went with hills since hills seem to fatigue the muscles much more than the nervous system and because I haven't done hills in a while. I was going quite a bit faster today than last time. I think I started around 2:03 then slowed down until I was running high 2:0xs last time. This time I started at 2:03 then dropped under 2 for a few. I was running through the bike sign for around 10 secs at the top this time. Jog down was around 3 mins.

I really paid attention to form on the short hills. My from is a lot better when I make an effort to tuck my butt in. My feet stay more under my body, and my arms keep pumping. I need to put some effort into loosening my hip flexors and psoas and strengthening my glutes."

No splits except the first 20. That was 3.7 in 20 mins, which is 5:24 pace. Right where I wanted to be. I was hoping to drop a few seconds per interval and finish up around 5:15 pace, but I'm not sure if I did. I wiped out on some gravel right before I was supposed to start the 10 and took a bit of extra rest to run it off. Both knees were bloodied up for the rest of the workout.

I wanted to go 2 hrs but did a route where I could cut off 2 miles on the way back if it was really hurting. Started out easy and just let the pace progress. Knee was tight for 30 mins then really loosened up and didn't bother me at all. 6:30, 24, 14 for 3-6. Mastick trail 3 in 18:30 on the way back, and then 5:55-6:10 pace until around 2.5 to go. The knee started feeling weak at that point so I backed off. I was pretty tired for the last couple miles, but I was probably pretty depleted because I didn't fuel at all today.

2. Go on effort

Workout was 1 min on/1 off. I was planning on 60 minutes, but after 50 I felt a pinch behind my knee and stopped. It didn't hurt at all during the cooldown. Not trying to get it inflamed again. Paces varied quite a bit. I felt like I would do 10 mins of 5:00-10/6:10-20 then 10 mins of 4:45-55/6:30-40. I'm not sure how well this workout accomplishes this, but I was hoping to produce similar effects to a run in the LT to marathon pace range without actually running those paces. Solid workout whether I accomplished that or not.

Still trying to figure out what's up with my quads. I'm thinking my stride might have changed slightly with my stretching and strengthening, so I'm using those muscles more now. If that's the case, they'll get used to it soon."

I was thinking about doing 4ks, which would have made my rest 2:20ish, but I was at or under threshold pace on a day when I'm sure effort was a bit harder (windy and snowing), so I took the extra 80 secs of resting instead of running. Dropped the extra 400 on the last 2 since my only reason for doing it was to shorten rest. Felt pretty good throughout. Running behind people wasn't too bad, but leading sucked a bit.

Odds CCW and evens CW. Mild R glute issues on 3. Disappeared when I was turning the other way. I think 1 and 2 were slight neg splits (5:18, 5:11-14) and 3 and 4 were pos (5:09-11, 5:15-17)"

I was a bit disappointed with this in the moment, but not now that I look at it as a whole. I wanted to do (30 @ M, 5 @ T) x 2 mid run, but my right glute was giving me trouble halfway through. I stopped and stretched it out then tried to get going again, but it felt really tight if I went much faster than 5:50. On the way out I was clicking off 5:35s and feeling great, then ran the tempo 5 mins at low 5:20 pace. Back was mostly 5:45-6:15. My sense of pace was thrown off after the first section, and that pace felt like a jog. stopped by the car for a second and changed out of flats and threw tights on then jogged the marina loop, which is 4.8, in just under 32 mins. I need to put in more work toward rehabbing the glute this week. I've been using body weight, but we have ankle weights I can throw on to increase resistance.

Didn't add the time correctly at first. I had it at 1:56, and then realized that 5:48 pace didn't make any sense when I thought about it."

I decided to keep today's workout on the easy side so I can hopefully get some good quality in with Dom this weekend. This is one of the few classic 08-09 JCU workouts that I like enough to do on my own. We used to take 5 mins between. The route came out somewhere around 2.8 miles each, or maybe a bit more, putting it at 5:20 or just under. Finished on the track and I was running 79 sec laps, but I always run a bit faster when I hit the track.

I was going to do 4 x 800 @ 5k w/ full recovery, but my hip didn't take kindly to the turns during the first, so I decided I'd just do striders on the football field. The hip held up well, overall. Some tightness after 10 mins. I need to do hurdle drills more often. They really hit the muscles I need to work on. Short cooldown, but I'll run another 30-40 mins tonight."

First 2 were 4:50-52, which I was fine with. It was windy out, so I wasn't stressing about staying 4:50 or under. Started having trouble during the third 16. Went out on pace but then slowed down big time and felt like crap during the next lap, so I dropped at 1000 to recover and run the 1000s with Emil. He wasn't feeling great either, so we slowed it down. ran 3:07, 3:06, 3:00. He made me look silly during the last 200 probably running around 28 while I closed in 33. 3 days to recover for the race.

Running into the wind solo during 6 and 7 was rough. Regrouped a bit running with the wind and ran a mile with Dom when he came back. Got it together to run a 5:08 last mile and catch someone. Results say that Dom was the only person who passed me in the 2nd half and I passed 4 people. I would definitely hang back with him so I wasn't alone going in to the wind if I did it again.

Zig zagged around a bit in University Heights in order to finish 25 mins at JCU so we could get a drink. Went 4.65, which is 5:22 pace. Really solid, especially considering that it's a slow, steady uphill the whole way. 6 min rest (3 walk inside, 3 jog) then 20 toward and on the shaker bike path. Just under 3.7, so the pace was around 5:26. My glute started tightening up a bit during this. 4 min jog, then 1.85 in 10 (5:24 pace). 2 min jog then a bit under a mile in 5 mins (around 5:15 pace for .95). Felt strong during the last 5.

Weather was great for this one. 50 and raining a little as we warmed up but then let up. Before the first interval, Fred asked me if I'm one of those nutjobs who goes out in 70 then comes back in 75. I said I sometimes get a bit excited on the first one, so he took it. Of course, he goes 70, 75. We were both a bit uneven on our pacing today, but I guess that comes with spending less time on the track. The best was the one where we went 35/39 for the first lap. I was happy with the way the 1ks went though. First and last were the fastest at 3flat or just under.

Took 4 or 5 mins before the 400s then went 63, 64. My shoe ripped open on the 2nd one. 800s at BW in January was my first workout in those, so I'm kind of salty about that. I definitely won't be going with the streak LTs again. The toe box is too narrow and delicate to handle my fat, flat feet. My legs were pretty dead, so I finished with a couple of 200s instead of forcing it for more 400s."

It was a bit cold and windy out there. Not a good day to run a fast time. The first 100 meters was the fastest I've run in a long time. I had to get out really hard to get into the lead. Took it through 400 in 63 (right on pace). Pretty much the whole field was 63-65. I veered outside during the last turn and let Pat go by on the inside. It was a bit slow, but pretty much everybody ran positive splits. It didn't take anything out of me. I felt springy after."

Felt sluggish on the warmup, but that might just be because I ran it pretty fast (19:40 for 3). Felt great once I started the workout, though. Ran at Lakewood park on the 1 mile loop, starting and finishing at the hairpin turn so that I could run through the finish for a few meters instead of doing the turn. No markers along the way. These could be a few seconds short because of taking tangents and whatnot, but they're pretty close.

Jogged over to the eastern loop (.65 miles) after that. Went a bit hard on the first one, so I gave myself a little extra rest (2:45). Slowed down a bit and kept the rest in the 2:20s. Hit the last minute of the 4th one fairly hard.

Instead of 400s at mile pace, I did a few hills. I would have done more, but the gravel was starting to hurt my feet. Really happy with this workout and excited for this Friday."

I did my south from hogsback 10 miler today. Out in just under 35 minutes. Just after I turned around, a cyclist rolled up next to me and we started chatting. He was going my pace at first, but he gradually picked it up and I didn't notice until I checked a half mile split and found out I was going 6:15 pace. I told him I needed to back off a little bit after that. Ended up coming back in 32:45.

Legs felt somewhere between okay and good. Workout was 2 x 5 @M, 1 @ T. I did the workout on a lollipop route in Lakewood, and I had a vague idea of where the 1/5 mile mark was and I knew where the halfway point was. Got out a bit fast on the first one. It's downhill, but I hit 3 in 16:15. Tried to back off, but not too much, on the way back, but I gauged it incorrectly with running uphill and ended up finishing in 32:50. Stopped for just long enough to drink a bit of gatorade and fix my socks which had bunched up, and then went out for the 2nd. I paced that one a lot better, hitting just over 3 (had to take a slightly longer way to avoid stopping) in 17, and then cutting it down on the way back to finish in 33:05. Cooled down 15 mins.

Great workout for me coming off a bad race. Finished with quite a bit in the tank. Even though the down time was only around 5 mins, I didn't feel like I ran 20 miles."

Ran the Fond du Lac Turkey Trot. It snowed an in or 2 the night before so the roads were slippery. I was running with a small group for the first 3/4 mile or so, then the eventual winner picked it up a bit. I ran with another guy for a couple more mins then passed him and ran by myself for the rest of the race. I made a couple of pushes in the second half, but nothing sustained enough to close the gap. ended up losing by about 40 secs. The winner was the same guy who ran a time in the low 24s last year, and I knew that from when he accelerated away from us, so that probably played into my complacency. It was a good sustained effort, but not much of a race. I won a turkey though. And Hailey ran her first race ever. Jogged out a half mile or so then ran back with her."

I got on one that was supposed to go up to 12 mph, but it wouldn't go faster than 10.9, and after 8 or 9 mins it started lurching. I'm guessing the belt was slipping. Luckily, I was able to jump over onto the other decent treadmill.

The workout didn't feel too taxing physically, but running on a treadmill was old after about 2 minutes. They don't have any fans and the treadmills are really shakey. I kept the pace in the 5:20-30 range and then picked it up to 5 min pace for the last min. Incline moved around between 0 and 2%."

Distances: 2.75 up, 2.75 tempo, (1 up + 1 down on hills), just over 3 back. Calling it 10.5

I could feel just a little bit of movement in my patella during the warmup. Nothing too concerning, but I need to keep strengthening. I might try to get on a leg extension machine to isolate the quads, rather than relying on squats and lunges."

Decided today would be a good day to get back on the longer Franklin hill. Made it a bit longer so it was 500 meters (maybe slightly short) instead of 450ish. Today every rep after the first couple felt fairly tough. Times were in the low 1:30s with about 2:45 recovery. I briefly considered around 3-5 cutting the workout to 6 or 7, but I managed to hang in there. This workout didn't get a lot harder as it progressed, but each rep by itself was fairly tough. I was expecting it to be mostly leg fatigue, but it was actually fairly tough aerobically.

Wanted to do 5xmile at 10k w/ 3-4 min rest. The stretch of greenway between 26th ave and the river is just barely over a mile long, so I decided I'd just use the whole thing instead of trying to shorten by a few hundredths of a mile.

Went 5:20, 5:18, 5:14, 5:20, 5:04. Subtract between 6 and 12 seconds from those times for the mile time. Happy with the effort, especially on a night like this. Excited for the race this weekend and hoping I can run the week after."

Felt decent overall though, other than my left shin which is had been slightly sore and was getting worse toward the end of the run. I think it's just a little tendinitis from skiing.
