Not sure when I last did these, but I am weak.

In other news, Brett Favre reported to training camp today. Mike McCarthy better make him the starter; after Aaron Rodgers' performance in the scrimmage last night there is no way you can convince me that the team has a better chance to win with him under center than with Favre."

I'll be cheering for him as a Jet, but it's really disappointing that everything had to end this way. It still doesn't make sense to me that the Packers didn't want one of the best quarterbacks of all time who often happened to be coming off of a career year. They put out a statement a month ago saying they wanted to 'protect Brett's legacy,' but then they released false stories about a comeback in March that didn't happen and about Favre using a team-issued cell phone to talk with the Vikings, tried to buy him off to stay retired, compared his return to crossing the Rubicon, and held a press conference claiming 'his head wasn't in the right place.' Real classy guys. Kick your hall of fame quarterback to the curb for no real reason. Yes I know he 'retired', but give me a break; he changed his mind before anything of significance happened (he first told the team he wanted to come back in June). If the Packers had wanted him back it would have been no problem and Aaron Rodgers would have been the only person upset. So now instead of having everything back from a team that was a play or two away from the Super Bowl we have no quarterbacks on the roster that have started an NFL game. If the Jets make the playoffs this season and the Packers don't Ted Thompson might need to pull a Theo Epstein and leave Lambeau in a gorilla suit. Boom, outta here Ted."

Kari refused our initial offer of 2 pairs of pants, and eventually we negotiated that she would give us the sign if we ran back to the cabin (5 miles away) naked. Kari gave us Crowne Royale bags to cover our manhood, and we stripped down in the bar.

Today was the annual 20x400 workout, and for the second year in a row I didn't finish.

After the first couple I consistently hit 80-81 through number 14 but then a gorilla jumped on my back as I struggled to an 84 on #15 and an 86 on #16. Since I had been dropped by the group at this point Griff had me jog a few minutes to bring my heart rate down then do 4 1 minute runs @ race effort with 1 minute recovery.

The last 2K felt really good.  It adds up to 8000 meters in around 27:10; not bad considering how little running I've done in the past month, but I need to get much faster in the next two weeks.

The team ran really well at Colfax.  The conditions were perfect and the course is fast as it is, so times were crazy.

Didn't plan on going this long, but after an hour I figured I might as well since I wasn't bored out of my mind yet.  The women's team was doing some type of interval workout on the treadmills.  No motivation to do abs today so I only made it halfway through Pillar and then stopped."

Watched The Empire Strikes Back.  A guy that must have been 70 came over and asked if that was 'my stimulation for the day' and wondered why I was going to exercise for so long.  I explained why, but I'm not sure he understood.  I actually felt pretty good the whole time, but was glad to be done.  Immediately rushed back to Ytterboe to watch Florida v. Alabama."

The fast segments were about 200 strides per minute with increased resistance.

Overall 2008 was a pretty good year for me running wise.  The top moment was definitely coming back from my stress fracture to run an amazing race and help the team win the MIAC cross country meet; the nationals trip and my 10K at outdoor conference would be next.  I also had two separate blocks of strong training (January, August) where my confidence was sky high.  As for low points, I had a serious injury that cost me the cross country regular season as well as any real training in December, and I was embarrassed in the indoor conference 5K."

Finished off with four strides; Lundin made a comment during each one. My quads and hamstrings are extremely sore both from the mileage and from doing squats and lunges yesterday.

Felt ok for the most part, about halfway through my left arch started to hurt but that went away after 10-15 minutes. The snow made it hard to get into a rhythm. I ran an extended Jefferson loop with cross campus at both the beginning and end. Then I drank Endurox and proceeded to sit in a chair for 2.5 hours watching football. When I got to the caf I was shaking because I was so hungry...in the future I'll need to make sure I eat more on long run days."
01/19/2009,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran the Jefferson loop again with Adrian. It was a really nice day outside. Tumnus turned off at the high school to poop; I thought I would just continue back to Olaf but I made it about three more blocks before I had to stop. Felt much better after this.

The wind coming back on 19 was noticeable but not terrible. I felt pretty tired, probably because I've done 87 miles in the past 7 days (and one of those days was a 5 miler). That was pretty dumb, but there's nothing I can do about it now."
01/22/2009,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,11.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran a slightly extended version of the Jefferson loop.

The meet was fun to watch and made me eager to get back to racing. Most of our guys ran pretty well - Cullen soloed a 1:57, Dobuol and Green ran ok times in the 1000, Perk had a nice mile, and Tumnus ran a lot better than last week. The 3K was disgusting, Gleason went out and ran consistent 34s like clockwork, but Gamble stuck and eventually ran the last 400 in 61 for the win in 8:25. Wow. I wish I would have gotten a double in one of these past three days, but I suppose the little 'break' will help."
01/25/2009,2:00 PM,Run,Long,15.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Long run with Nussbaum and Adrian. We did Cornhole to Canada to Jefferson, then 10 minutes inside. It was below 0, but I was dressed warm enough. My face and left hand got a bit cold but other than that I was fine. For the first half of the run my stomach felt bad because I ate lunch too close to the run, but for about the last six miles I got into a good rhythm. It was really nice to have companions on this run - I definitely would have cut it short without those guys there."

Keegan tagged along with us in the afternoon and when everyone else turned off to just do cross campus it was just me and him. He kept up and when I suggested he join the team since he's running everyday anyway he said he might at some point in the future. Whatever... Felt better at the end of the run than at the beginning, just need to make it to the end of the week and then over break I can make up for the sleep I've missed."

Finally got around to doing my first workout since CC nationals. I did it on the upstairs track in the morning so I wouldn't have to go around so many people.

Cool-down: 

Ran my first track workout since the end of cross country before the meet. It was a shock to the system, especially since I started too fast. I wanted to start at about 76 and work down from there, but I ran the first two in 73. After that I ran 75s with maybe 2 76s thrown in there. The pace felt harder than it should have, not surprising though considering it was my first time on the track, I've slept 11 hours total in the past two nights, and I barely ate anything all day. The meet was disappointing for the most part - Cullen ran a really good 1000 and Tumnus had a nice kick in the mile, but nobody else on the distance squad ran outstanding."

It was a good effort though and that's the real point of these. Felt alright, the elements bothered me but aerobically I was fine. The first minute of the second segment was a little rough.

I would have liked to be faster on the 1000 but the 3:07 felt really easy. The 400s weren't aerobically taxing at all but my legs would get tired in the last 100. Just need to add a few extra gears. Schwock and I ran together the whole way. He is really fit right now. The 3K this weekend will be fun."

During our first interval a dog came after us and tried to kill us, but we luckily managed to escape.  Then on the cooldown we were running through a spot on the course that Griff said was fine, but Chris slipped on some ice and went airborne before falling.  I almost stepped right on his face.  Did a couple laps inside to finish it off.  Hopefully my legs will come around before Saturday - there are 23 people in my race but not many that are terribly fast.

I had to stop at the retirement community a half mile from campus to poop, and have since gone three more times in the past two hours.

I went out on the dirt roads for a while and was able to think some things over and start feeling a little better.  I got going pretty good in the middle: 5:58, 5:57, 5:40, 5:45, 5:50, 5:50 = 35:00 for one six mile stretch.  Stopped with about two miles to go and did a few strides.  Tomorrow will be a better day."

The 400s were easy to just gut out.  My pulse at the end was 165 and I was definitely tired.

These were decent, but I was working hard to hit times that weren't very fast.  I did 300s at the end instead of 400s because I thought they would be easier.  I felt sick all day, but I thought I would be able to get through the workout ok - I guess I was wrong.  Kind of discouraging.

After the run I was in the locker room stretching and listening to Dobuol's new CD when two professors walked in.  Less than a minute later the CD switched to 'My Dick.'  I quickly rushed over to skip to the next song."

I did it on Carleton's track since ours has a huge puddle in lane 1 on the home stretch.  It was really windy which wasn't fun, but this is still preferable to running inside.  My legs felt a little tired but aerobically I felt pretty strong.  I ended up doing 11 intervals since the first one was pretty slow.  Would have liked a faster average, but I figure the wind was worth 2-3 seconds and I was alone.  Did 3 150s at the end to simulate the finish of a race."

Did a 23 minute tempo at 5:30 pace.  It felt incredibly easy and I was tempted to keep going for another mile or so but decided I had already accomplished the goal of the workout so there was no reason to.  Then I went to the cities to get on the plane for Arizona.  We landed just as the Wisconsin game started, but unfortunately our bags took a long time to show up and then it took forever to find our hotel, so I only got to see the last two minutes and the overtime.  It was worth it since we ended up winning."

My mom does not like the place so that will make things a bit awkward.  Just before halftime of the Texas v Duke game I headed out for a short run.  Ran on some hilly trails for a little while, then headed out on the highway for a few minutes, then back on the trails to finish up.  We are at higher altitude so the hills felt tougher than in Northfield.  So far it doesn't look like there are many great places to run around here, but I'll make do."

I woke up at 9 AM, turned on the TV, and the NCAA Tournament was starting thanks to the time zone difference.  I watched bits and pieces of the first game, then streamed the Wisconsin game through my computer.  We lost in the same fashion we've lost most of our games this season - get a lead towards the beginning of the second half, let the other team back in it, and then go cold shooting at the end.  Then I decided I should go for a run.  I found out last night that the area we were in is not very safe, so that plus the 30+ mph winds convinced me to run on a treadmill.  My plan was to run until I got bored, which happened after about 30 minutes.  This wouldn't cut it though, so I convinced myself to go 10 more minutes, and kept doing that until I hit 12 miles.  We ended up moving to a new place tonight - the original place just wouldn't have worked for the entire week (there was some drama last night after I went to bed).  Our new place is much nicer and in a much better area as well.  No more treadmill running thankfully."

This afternoon my mom and I went to see the Angels play the Dodgers in a spring training game.  The traffic going to the stadium was so bad that it took us 90 minutes to drive the 30 miles from our place.  This was seriously the worst traffic I've ever seen going to a sporting event.  It was fun to see baseball again, but the game was uneventful for the most part.  The Angels won 10-4 thanks to three home runs."

I found a secluded road behind a golf course to use for the intervals - this was nice because I wouldn't have to keep stopping at lights.  For the most part I felt smooth and relaxed, the only interval that really got tough was the last 3:00 one.  If I had to guess I'd say I was right around 5:00 pace for the first set, a bit faster on the second set, and 67-68 second 400 pace for the last set."

I'll hope it's the first one.  Between the tempo and the last intervals I had to poop so I found a small clump of woods and took care of it in there.  Kind of sketchy but it had to be done.  The 1500 pace intervals were a little fast but they were short so not too challenging.  My pulse at the end of the workout was 183, less than three minutes later it was 114."

I ran at about 6:45 PM because I watched both basketball games this afternoon.  Go UNC!  Once I started running I got into a great rhythm and felt effortless the entire way.  The weather was great - 40 degrees and no wind.  It got dark about an hour in but the street lights provided enough visibility.  Assuming I started off at close to 7 minute pace as I usually do I probably ran the last 10 miles in under 62 minutes, and I felt awesome doing it.  At one point I considered continuing on to make it a 20 miler but decided that would be counter productive.  Hopefully I feel this good on the day of my 10K."

The hill on the fourth mile of the old course was tough all three times.  The mid d guys only did two loops, so I did the third one with Pez, Tumnus, Paille, and Anders.

I felt relaxed during the workout, but on the cool down my legs were wrecked from my past three days.  It didn't help that our cool down was fairly long.  I think I'll take tomorrow pretty easy.  It's still up in the air where I'm going to run the 10K - I've started campaigning to go to Augustana and Griff agreed to it yesterday but now is backing off of that.  We'll see what happens."

I ran with Pez and Tumnus and the paces during the intervals felt pretty relaxed...we probably ran a little slow but I'm fine with it.  It looks like I'll have a nice pack of guys to race with in the 1500 on Saturday, it should be fun."

Dobuol decided to do this instead of the 1500 workout since it was his first workout in a while.  Him and I took turns leading and Pez just sat behind.  I felt pretty smooth the entire time, but with the wind it was definitely a hard workout.  I wasn't 100% spent at the end but I would not have wanted to do any more.  On the first mile I had to run one of the curves in lane 4 because the women's team was all over the place - they didn't understand the concept of getting out of lane 1 when you finish your interval.  Every time Dobuol led he would start off a little fast, but it was ok.  I'm looking forward to the 5K on Thursday - hopefully some fast guys from UST and SJU run it."

The biggest surprise was Paul Ranum splitting a 51.x on the 4x400, once we get Doyle back this relay will be strong."

I didn't feel fantastic or anything but I was able to click these off without any problems.  I led all of the intervals except the second 400.  Griff had us scheduled for more intervals than this but I cut it down because I want to make sure I'm fully rested for Friday.  I found out there are 10 or 11 sub 15:00 5kers in the Augie 10K, so it will definitely be fast.  Also, apparently the last 200 of my 5K last Thursday was 28.9.

The first six minutes felt easy and afterward I thought I might have run it too slow, but then I realized that running six minutes at a pace that I can maintain for a half hour should feel easy.  The 5 minute interval at the end was a nice challenge - it forced me to push through being tired and keep going.  It felt good to open up a bit on the last two intervals.  It was hot and windy but I could stay out of a lot of it.  Only two guys broke 31 at Drake because of the weather, so I'm definitely glad I went to Augustana last weekend."

Ran kind of a hodge podge of trails to get it to be the correct amount of time.  My legs didn't feel very good, probably had something to do with the 85 degree temperatures.

Frick, I'm six days out from conference and I feel like shit.  Didn't do much all day, just sat in my room drinking a ton of water and doing some homework.  I was going to take the day off from running but eventually decided to do an easy 3 so that I could keep my streak of not missing a day in 2009 going.  I hope I get better quickly.  Schantzen broke the school record in the shot put with a 17.17!"

I went out to run thinking I'd go anywhere from 10-13, and 12.5 was where I ended up.  Did the Jefferson loop plus the baby arb loop connected to cross campus.  No problems with breathing, my nose was still a little stuffed up but I'll be good to go in a few days."

Unfortunately it didn't feel as easy as it should have; I could feel some effects of my sickness.  No worries though, I'll get my rest and be ready to go on Friday.  The 1200 was worth at least 3:42 because the women's team had steeple barriers set up that I had to keep running around.  It felt good to open it up on the last 200.  Maybe I'll close that fast in my 10K - yeah right."
05/05/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,7.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Last double of the season.  I decided to do my longer run in the morning so that I could just screw around at practice.  Ran on the course by myself.  Felt ok, not great but better than yesterday."
05/05/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"This run was a joke.  I did cross campus with some other guys.  We took two walk breaks (the usual one behind the stadium and then we walked up a hill on the Carleton campus).  Tumnus hit the sign right in front of a Carleton campus officer, and the officer thought he was actually hurt.  He came over and put his hand on Adrian's shoulder while repeatedly asking, 'Sir, are you ok?'  After a few seconds of this someone yelled, 'They should put up a sign for that sign!' and we all ran away laughing hysterically.  Did a few laps on the track afterward and also some hurdles just for the heck of it.  It was nice to just have fun at practice rather than having to worry about getting a quality run in.  Also, Griff has developed an annoying habit of looking at my eyes daily to determine whether I'm getting enough sleep.  Today he told me I looked tired, and I was thinking, 'yeah, either that or I'm squinting because I've been sitting inside all day and it's really bright out here.'  He wants me to do next to nothing the rest of the week.  I'm going to stick to my usual routine."

Some people were cutting a tree down in the Arb so I had to take a slight detour but it ended up being roughly the same distance.  Griff yelled at me afterward for going this far, but this is what I've done before every big race for the past two years and it's almost always worked well.  I'll stick with it.  The run felt good, I think I'm just about back to normal after this sickness.  Two nights of good sleep and an easy day tomorrow and I'll really be ready."

Ben Bayer won Skildum in 10:59.  As always the race was hilarious and fun to watch.  It's supposed to thunderstrom tomorrow, here's hoping it holds off until after the 10K.

We didn't qualify anyone for finals that we didn't expect to (although Burseth almost slipped through in the 800), but we didn't have anyone that was expected to make it not get through.  The 4x800 guys ran well - none of them had broken 2:00 outdoors and they all did tonight to run 7:52 and finish 3rd.  We're going to need some big performances tomorrow to finish well in the standings."

We couldn't have placed higher but could have gotten closer to the top 4 if Tut hadn't been disqualified in the 400 and Cullen hadn't been been nosed out by two guys in the 800.  The 4x400 was one of the best races I've ever seen - 5 teams provo'ed and we got fourth with a 3:15.73.  Dan 49.0, Cullen 49.7, Tut 47.7, Doyle 49.1.  Everyone except Tut basically PRed by a full second.  Schantzen won the shot put so we had two event champions."

Good conversation the whole way.  My legs were tired but not real sore.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do about racing this week.  I really want to do the 5K at La Crosse and try to break 15, but finals are Friday and Saturday and my parents have expressed their strong preference that I not race.  I might do it anyway, but if I do and then finals don't go well I don't want to hear about it all summer.  I'll figure it out by Tuesday."

I'm not going to race on Thursday because of finals - it's just too much to try to race Thursday night then take four tests on Friday and Saturday.  I'll keep running this week in case by some miracle I slip into nationals and then take my time off after I go home."

I was all by myself at practice since everyone else either is taking time off or was competing at La Crosse so that was a little depressing.  The workout went fine - I hit all my splits without too much effort.  Did Baby Burner for the first time all year for a cool down.  I'm barely sleeping right now, my average bedtime between now and next Tuesday will probably be 3 AM.  I hate finals with a passion, especially since I had to miss the La Crosse meet because of them.

The gun went off at 10 - all day I had not been planning on running but as it got closer I started getting the urge to try it and at 9:30 I flipped a coin to decide.  Ran a two mile warmup and then started.  The first beer and lap went fine, then I really struggled with the second beer, then on the homestretch of the second lap I puked on the infield.  I didn't want to take another 15 minutes and puke 5 more times so I just quit.  Gotta train a bit for the next one I guess :)"

Brock was the first person out of the pool, Ben kept a good sized lead on the bike, and I ended up bringing us home for about an eight minute win with a 17:02 5K on the course.  It was a decent effort but by no means anywhere near all out.  I've slept maybe 16 hours in the past three nights including four last night and I ran in trainers.  No cool down, season's over.

Never felt terribly drunk, just had a solid buzz going for several hours.

It was only 75 degrees out, Lord help me when the temperature hits 90+.  Did Pedestal right after the run because I went to the Brewers game and wouldn't have been able to do it at night."

We did a loop from Lawrence to Wisconsin Ave to Badger, around Pierce Park and Lutz Park, then back down College Ave to the start.  Good conversation the entire way.  The loop was exactly 8 miles so the pace is accurate.  We probably ran the last two miles in just over 12 minutes.  Did Pedestal when I got home."

I was tired and a bit sore on the run, most likely because I haven't done back to back 10 milers in quite a while.  My right leg has had a bunch of weird aches and pains all day.  Didn't eat or drink enough during the day so that didn't help.  I ran past a softball game just in time to see a girl hit a foul ball and crack a windshield, then later saw Nate Lynch standing in a random yard talking on his cell phone.

It felt good to get on the grass for a good portion of the run, even if I was just running large loops around a not very exciting park.  My legs felt better than yesterday but were still a little sore.  By next week this should be second nature."

Felt alright, didn't eat a big enough breakfast so I started getting hungry about the last 15 minutes.  After the run the second toe on my left foot felt like it was broken and I couldn't walk normally for about two hours.  After sitting the car for three hours driving to La Crosse it felt fine.  Weird.  

The state 3200 was awesome with six guys 9:15 or faster.  Storkel went out in 62, the three leaders went through the mile in 4:32, and Brill dropped about a 2:06 last 800 to win.  The East 4x800 ran terrible.  I saw Dave Ricks at the meet - he tried to introduce me to Chas Karch not realizing that Chas and I ran together for a year in high school.  Massey finished 2nd in MN in 9:19...awesome."

Nothing special happened.  Taylor led the first 1300 of the mile but then Ross, Brill, and Storkel all blew by and he finished 4th in 4:16.  Disappointing, but he'll get it next year.  He came back and finished 2nd in the 800 in 1:54 which was exciting.  It was under 50 degrees and poured all day at the meet - not very comfortable for spectating.  I was warmer than some other people though ;)

Also, my eating today consisted of this:
Breakfast - 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast
5:45 PM - 3 pieces of cold pizza and 1/4 big bag of M&Ms
9 PM - Cousins sub and medium Coke
Not exactly the diet of champions."

I was really tired all day and started off quite slow but about 3 miles into the run I started feeling really good and strong.  There are two decent size uphills on this route and I pushed it up both.  In the last mile I got the urge to crank it so I kept speeding up and probably got down to 5:00 pace for a minute or so before slowing it down as I finished.  My time today was 2 1/2 minutes faster than I ran this loop at the end of July last summer and it was probably about the same effort."

The first four miles weren't very fun because I ate Taco Bell an hour before running, but after that I felt really good.  I'm not sure what's up with this weather; I've only run shirtless two or three times all summer because it's always 60 degrees or cooler.  Seeing as I struggle with the heat though I'm not complaining.  Went to the Brewers game at night where I saw a crew playing Survivor Man in the parking lot...didn't know anyone besides Oles and Hamdogs played that.  We moved down to some better seats, and when the usher came and asked to see our tickets my dad BSed with him for a minute and he finally decided to just let us stay.

During the run I almost collided with multiple people walking their pets that were oblivious to their surroundings.  People need to be more alert.  Also got really hungry in the last mile or so since I didn't have a snack between work and running.  I ate dinner immediately upon finishing and then got roped into mowing the lawn.

It was great being able to do this on trails, and to be in the shade since it was decently hot out.  The trails were mostly flat with some rolling parts.  I ran an out and back with mile markers but I only checked my splits a couple times.  Saw a lot of people biking, mostly families with little kids.  At the end some guys came up to me in the parking lot and asked why I would run so far, what pace I run, what my fastest marathon was, etc.  I tried to explain all of this to them but I don't think they 'got it.'

I definitely took a different route back than I took going out since it took about half the time, so I turned around and added on some more.  It was very hot and humid and when I was running on unshaded paths I got very warm.

I only slept about 5 1/2 hours last night.  I've decided to try to log my sleep on here, at least for a little while, because based on the past few months I clearly need to monitor it more closely."

Stopped briefly at a gas station so he could get some water.  It was great to run with somebody else and we had a good conversation the entire way which made the time fly by.  It was pretty hot once again, and I must be dehydrated because I have quite the headache right now.  It's supposed to be over 90 tomorrow...probably going to eat dinner right after work and then run at like 7:30."

I waited until 8 PM to run because it was 95 degrees with a heat index of over 100 this afternoon.  I felt mediocre on the warmup but then when I started running fast I felt great.  By the time I ran the weather was somewhat nice since it had cooled off about 10 degrees and there was no wind.  Finished with five strides (four short, one long) and a 10 minute cooldown.

After a three mile warmup I did 13 one minute surges at about cross country race pace with one minute intervals.  This wasn't really taxing at all, just trying to stay in touch with running faster than my normal running pace.  There were a lot of bikers and walkers on the trails this morning and several of them felt the need to make comments regarding my pace as they either passed or got passed."

Ran my five mile loop around the Horseshoe Bay area and tried to stay in the grass as much as possible.  When I finished I thought we would be eating dinner shortly but my dad and brother decided to golf 18 holes instead of 9 so we didn't eat until around 8:15.  By this point I was extremely hungry."
06/28/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Long,15.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"First 15 miler of the summer.  Did it at Peninsula so that I could keep up my practice of doing my long runs on trails.  I woke up later than I intended so I didn't eat much before I left.  About four miles into the run I got hungry and started wondering whether I would be able to finish, but I just told myself not to think about it and after a little while the hunger went away.  I felt strong pretty much the whole way and was able to pick it up pretty well the last two miles.  Good week.

After the run I watched the USA v Brazil soccer match, the second half of which felt like a huge punch in the stomach.  At least we beat Spain, but it would have been awesome to finish off Brazil as well.  Then I watched the last day of the US track nationals which was disappointing because none of the races were exciting.  Webb didn't even show up for the 1500m and it ended up going out in 2:03.  Gotta give Ulrey credit for showing up and getting top 3, but he's at best the 10th or 11th best 1500m guy in the US right now."

The wind was in my face on the way out which slowed me down but when I turned around I started feeling really good.  On Fremont St I ran down David Saucerman and talked to him for a few minutes.  Finished with four strides.  Dinner was ready when I got in so I skipped general strength again.  Probably won't do much of that this week but starting next week I need to get back on it."

I was scheduled for a 20 minute tempo and then a few faster intervals, but on the warmup my calves were incredibly tight and it hurt to run.  I stretched out before starting the tempo but that didn't do much.  By the 14 minute mark the burning in my calves was really slowing me down and my left foot was starting to go somewhat numb so I stopped and walked before jogging slowly back to my house (I was about a mile away).  Hopefully this was just a one day thing."

I could still feel the tightness in my calves but it wasn't nearly as bad as yesterday.  I'm going to try to just run through it and hopefully it will go away.  After the run I drove up north.  I had a tire blow out near Stevens Point which added about an hour and a half to my trip, but I made it eventually.  We went to KD's to celebrate Kelly's birthday and Chris called me on the bar's land line after finding out I was there.  My cousins were confused."
07/03/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,13.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Did a shorter long run this week.  I did an out and back on the route that we did our 16 miler on during camp last year (Hwy C south toward St Germaine) and turned around just past the Whitetail.  This gave me 12 and then I added on a mile at the start.  My calves felt fine at the start but tightened up about 20 minutes in.  Around 45 minutes it felt like my feet were falling asleep which was uncomfortable, but that only lasted like 10 minutes.  Finally when I got back on gravel the calves loosened up.  Spent the rest of the day out on the lake and was very tired when I went to bed at 11 PM."
07/04/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,7.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Did an easy out and back from the cabin.  Randomly ran into Dr Hagen as he was out doing an 'easy' 50 mile bike ride.  This route was mostly uphill on the way out which meant the way back was really easy.  Calves still felt tight.  Against my better judgment I did the swim across the lake.  Thankfully my calves didn't lock up during it but it was not real comfortable.  When I finished my pulse felt like at the end of a race.  Swimming is tough."

Just like yesterday the first part of the run was mostly uphill then I got to turn around and run back down.  Near the turnaround there was a hill that reminded me of Radar Hill.  Nothing exciting happened other than stopping twice to crap in the woods.  The pancakes I ate for lunch must not have agreed with me.  My calves felt much better - still noticeable but significantly improved.  I did five strides after the run."

I started too fast and I don't like to slow down on these workouts once I start so I had to adjust the plan to make sure the workout didn't get too difficult.  Wasn't feeling all that great since I sat around all day.  Finished up with two one minute runs at about 5K pace, it's easy to fake those."

Did an out and back on the CE Trail to Fieldcrest Drive.  I ran at like 8 PM and it was nice and cool.  My legs felt great and I ran sub 6:30 pace the entire way.  When I got home I was craving a Coke, but there weren't any in the fridge so I settled for a Miller High Life."

I didn't sleep much last night and was really tired all day but I decided to just get the long run over with tonight rather than potentially being tired from it on Monday when I take my exam.  I felt alright, just got a little worn out the last 3 or 4 miles.  I was still able to break it down though.  Got a lot of things yelled at me during the run, the ones worth remembering are below.

'I wish I had shorts like yours.'
'I want you!'
'Run Forrest Run!'  (said by a guy in his 20s driving a red convertible with a girl in the front seat)
'Why are you running so fast?'
'Put some clothes on, f@g!'"
07/11/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,8.50,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Easy run around town.  Did seven strides at the end.  Legs felt surprisingly good and my high stress levels contributed to a quick pace."

This workout wasn't hard at all, I just wanted to get something quicker in before I race next weekend.  I did it on the Newberry Trail just like during interim break.  Felt relaxed the whole way and I definitely could have done more if I had wanted to.  Always a good sign.  While I was warming up a car pulled up next to me, slowed down to my speed, and started blasting some rap music.  I looked over and saw two high school kids rocking out and staring at me.  I gave them a thumbs up, and the driver said 'See you later!' and proceeded to stomp on the accelerator of his piece of junk and speed away.  I laughed about the immaturity of kids these days.  Did a shorter cool down so I could get home for the All Star Game."

I woke up and did some work at home for a few hours then went for a run before going to the dealership for a  meeting.

I tried to go out slow but I still hit 11:57 at 2 miles, then was 23:41 at 4 (fourth mile is very hilly), then 5:30, 5:16, 5:15 for 39:42 total.  My legs felt tired warming up and didn't feel great during the workout but aerobically I felt relaxed.  It didn't get hard at all until the last 2-3 minutes.  Finished with strides and a cool down.  I'll probably do another one of these in a month or so."

Felt great on the way out, then around 10 miles I got a little hungry, but then I got a second wind and carried it in with no problems.  The Telulah bridge hill at the 15 mile mark was 'fun.'  While running through Menasha I saw a bunch of places my grandparents used to talk about but I hadn't known where they actually were."

I was still really tired when Phil woke me up but after a granola bar and some water I came to.  The first 10 minutes of the run felt bad; after that I felt alright.  The climb to the top was tough as always.  I was surprised to see Varley and Prez come all the way up.  On the way down Chris and I were ahead of everyone else, I turned around to look at the other guys for a second and the next thing I knew I was headed off the road.  I basically ran right into a bunch of trees but didn't get hurt at all.  We took a few breaks on the way back to Pettibone which was nice.  The post-run shower was much better than last year's."

The trail was out in the middle of nowhere, crushed gravel surface, and pretty much completely flat.  I only saw three or four other people the whole time I was running.  All the miles are marked which was nice.  Felt great the entire way, and I picked it up quite a bit on the way back for a 2+ minute negative split (52:45/50:30).  The last couple miles felt like a 10K in the sense that I just kept grinding it out.  Before I left for work I set the oven on timed bake to have my dinner done at 7:00, but my afternoon meeting went an hour later than it was supposed to and I finished running at 6:40 and was over 25 miles away.

I felt pretty good for most of it...my stomach had a few rough minutes in the middle thanks to the banana I ate right before but my legs felt fine throughout.  Thomas dropped out at 20 minutes, then Brice stopped at about 36:30 to take a shit, and Taylor and I finished the 7 in 40:25.  We did a two mile warmup and cooldown.  After the run we went to Brice's house and jumped in the lake.  I have a giant blood blister under one of my toenails on my left foot.

This wasn't real hard, just felt a little flat.  Afterward I did barefoot strides on the field behind Horizons.  Two girls that were probably about 12 came up and asked if they could run with me.  I said sure...one of them fell over after less than ten steps and the other started laughing so hard she soon stopped.  I tried not to laugh myself and simply walked over to my shoes, put them on, and left."
08/07/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,9.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran at High Cliff in the rain.  There was nobody else out there, I guess a downpour isn't the choice time of very many people to go for a walk/run.  Legs felt alright but I was really hungry for almost the entire run.  This was weird because I ate a pretty big lunch.  Did strides at the end."
08/08/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Long,16.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"I was going to race a two mile this morning but it was raining very hard when I woke up and I ended up not going.  Bad decision.  Around 4 PM I went out just intending to go 'long.'  I started out towards Neenah and since I felt good I decided I might as well try to make it to Riverside Park.  Made it there and then took a longer route home since one of the roads I ran on to get there wasn't very safe.  It was a 17 mile loop and after about 85 minutes the hot temps and high humidity got to me.  I felt fine at 13 miles, was struggling a little bit at 14, struggling a lot at 15, and toast at 16.  At this point I stopped and made the walk of shame home.  I also took a 5 Hour Energy shot this morning.  An hour after taking it I fell asleep for about 90 minutes...guess it didn't do anything for me."
08/09/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.50,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Easy day.  Way too hot to run outside so I did a short run on the treadmill and then a couple general strength circuits.  Felt fine."

08/11/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Hill,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"I was really tired all afternoon and almost fell asleep about 15 minutes before heading out.  Once I started running though I felt fine.  Went to the Banta Bowl Hill and did 11 repeats.  There's a bunch of construction going on by the hill right now so I probably wasn't supposed to be running there, but this is the only decent hill around so since there was nobody there I just did it anyway.  Ran the hills hard but not all out.  I was breathing hard at the end of each repeat but recovered quickly.  Felt pretty good throughout.  Excited for camp and the season."
08/12/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,7.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran in Appleton before leaving for Door County.  Despite eating a cream filled doughnut for breakfast I felt good.  Pretty humind this morning."
08/12/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Did an out and back on Bay Shore Drive.  It was nice having the breeze come off the bay.  Didn't eat much for lunch so I was a little hungry but nothing terrible.  Did a 20 second change of pace at the turn around and then four strides @ 8K pace at the end.  Might go for 100 this week."
08/13/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,11.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran to downtown Egg Harbor and back.  I got a really good night's sleep last night so I felt good even with all the mileage.  The big hill by the beach club kicked my ass as usual."
08/13/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.50,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Did my five mile tour of the Horseshoe Bay property.  Stopped a half mile from the house and did barefoot strides and some jogging on grass.  The first 100 meters of the run was pretty rough but I quickly got into it.  Nice win by the Brew Crew this afternoon."
08/14/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Terrible, terrible run.  Went to Peninsula planning to go long, but my stomach was unsettled and had me feeling awful by the two mile mark.  For most of the run I felt like I had to puke and I had to stop a couple times for a minute or so.  Ended up calling it a day at 10."
08/15/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,9.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran around Horseshoe Bay before driving back to Appleton.  It was really hot but the heat didn't bother me too badly.  My stomach felt much better than yesterday.  Legs were a little tired but ok.  Went to the first Packers exhibition game tonight...it was great to start off with a shutout win, even in a meaningless game."
08/16/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,13.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran at High Cliff.  Felt a lot better than the past couple days, almost back to normal I think.  Once I get through the GRE tomorrow I'll be able to catch back up on sleep.  It was really humid but for once it didn't phase me.  When I got done my shorts were as wet as if I'd gone swimming - it was gross.  Watched the 100m final from Worlds right before running and I think Bolt's 9.58 pumped me up because I started off very quick.  The guy is inhuman...blew Tyson Gay out of the water even though Gay ran the third fastest time ever.  I unintentionally scared an old lady walking by herself while coming up from behind and almost felt bad about it for a second but then decided she should be paying more attention to her surroundings.  Did two 20 second pickups toward the end of the run."

08/18/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Tempo,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Back up in Door County.  Did a 20 minute tempo on the lower part of Highway G, walked up the hill for a rest, and then did two more miles.  I felt strong on the first segment, and it was nice to run faster again after several days of just regular runs.  There was a headwind on the way out and a tailwind on the way back so that helped me get about 20 seconds past the starting point.  On the second part I went out in 5:30 then turned around and came back in 5:09.  Didn't feel hard at all.  Short cool down so I could get home in time for Brett Favre's press conference with the Vikings.  I hope the Packers' new 3-4 defense knocks his ass out on October 5th."

08/19/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Long,17.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Last solo long run of the summer, and the longest one I'll do.  Did it at Peninsula - two laps of an 8.5 mile loop.  The first lap I didn't feel all that good but as the run went on I gradually started feeling better.  Ironically the last mile of the whole thing felt the best and I picked it up a bit.  Had the song Fireflies by Owl City stuck in my head for a long time.  The 1500m final was anticlimactic as Lagat and Kiprop both ran with horrible tactics.  I was impressed with the South African woman (or maybe not?) that destroyed everyone with a 1:55."
08/20/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Short day #1.  Waited until 5:15 to run, just kept putting it off.  Felt alright, it was weird to run over 70 minutes less than yesterday.  Bolt 19.19!!!"
08/21/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Did an out and back on Highway B.  It was borderline cold this morning, only like 60 degrees.  Legs felt pretty good and I even ran all the way up the giant hill by the beach club."
08/21/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Easy run right before dinner.  The US guys screwed up in the 4x100 again...pathetic.  Did strides afterward and felt sort of fast haha."
08/22/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,11.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"This was an easy workout.  I was trying to run 5:00 pace on the intervals and think I did a good job of that, but with 2:00 rest I was always fully recovered by the start of the next one.  I underestimated the distance I would cover during the actual workout so I ended up running 11 miles instead of 10 since I wanted to do more than a 3 minute cool down.  1000 miles for the summer!"
08/23/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Short day #2 to finish off the down week.  Still got in more miles than I intended this week, but I feel like I recovered a good bit.  Ran after watching the Worlds 5K, which was awesome.  Bekele is definitely the greatest of all time, and Lagat ran exceptionally well too.  Last day in Appleton for the summer...I'm excited for the year but at the same time a little sad to be leaving."
08/24/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.50,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Last run in Appleton.  Felt good despite it being the earliest I had gone for a run in quite some time.  Did a few strides at the end."

Felt great the entire time and we probably had a sub 6:30 pace going for a couple miles.  Lots of different conversations that made the time pass really quickly."
08/26/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.50,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Easy shakeout run with everyone.  Did strides and about five extra minutes at the end.  Karaoke night at KD's!"

After the first 10 minutes I stopped noticing the rain and felt good.  Talked about making a team calendar - we've talked about this every year I've been on the team but never actually done it."
08/28/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Tumnus and Pez went out to run during a thunderstorm and I stayed inside to finish watching Apollo 13.  An hour later the rain had stopped so I went out by myself.  Felt good so I went a little longer.  I think I was inspired by Ritz's 12:56.  I also broke my cell phone this afternoon by dropping it on some bricks."
08/29/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,8.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran in the arb with some guys after the drive back to Northfield.  Didn't feel that great, but not terrible either.  Also had a team meeting with Lundin where he told us to 'Be prudent, use discretion, and not do anything stupid caused by getting shitfaced.'"
08/30/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,16.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Pez and I ran 5 miles on the course before practice, then met up with most of the team and ran Lando's Mom.  The team as a whole looks really fit.  I felt good the entire time but after the run ended I got really tired.  Radar Hill put the hurt on some people.

Thus concludes summer training.  Stats are below.
1,117 total miles (895.5 at this time last year)
95 days, 129 runs (0 days off)
Average miles per day: 11.8
Average miles per week: 82.3
Weeks over 80: 9  Over 90: 4  Over 100: 1
Runs of 15 miles of longer: 7
This summer was definitely the best base period I've ever had, so now it's time to make it translate into a strong season.  Last year I got injured in September and my season was shot.  If I can do everything possible to keep myself healthy my other goals should fall into place.  83 days til Nationals, let's go get it!"
08/31/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"As dictated by Griff we ran on 'the gravel roads NW of campus.'  Started off with everyone and people turned around at various points.  I think 7 guys went 10.  We ran pretty quick on the way back, sub 6:30s for a while.  Pretty uneventful run and my legs feel really tired."
08/31/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Fartlek,7.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Two miles with the team, then we separated and did 8 x 60 seconds and 8 x 30 seconds with equal recovery.  Dobuol and I ran together.  We covered just about 4 miles in the 23:30 so our average pace was fast.  I felt strong throughout and it was nice to run faster than regular running pace.  8 minute cooldown, we were ready to be done."
09/01/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,12.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Did an out and back on the old threshold course.  I went 12 Rivers, Pez, Dobuol, and Tumnus.  A group of us separated from the pack early on.  Felt good the entire time.  Saw Paul Nichol pumping iron when we got back."
09/01/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.50,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Did cross campus with the team.  It was a fun run, nice to relax a bit after the past couple days of pounding.  We saw Dave Ricks by the library and he was amused by our yelling."
09/02/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,7.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran the short arb loop with just about everybody.  We decided to go shorter because of the workout this afternoon.  Felt good, got a good night of sleep last night after team 2010's win in the bowling tournament."
09/02/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Tempo,10.50,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"3 mile warmup, 2+ mile cooldown

Ran a 20 minute tempo on the course by myself then 3 x 1 minute at 5K pace.  The other guys did something else but Griff and I decided it would be best for me to do this since my last couple workouts have all been shorter intervals.  I split an 81 for the first 400 and then didn't take any other splits.  Since I definitely didn't feel like I slowed down I'd say I averaged 5:25s.  Felt alright, the last couple minutes my legs were getting tired (as would be expected) but my breathing was never a problem.  Pez and I saw three deer on the back section of the course while cooling down.  After the cooldown I went inside and collapsed on the mat.  After tomorrow I'll be cutting mileage back to something more reasonable."
09/03/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Went out to Nerstrand.  Green came to run with us so I did most of the run with him and Chris.  Didn't sleep very well last night so I was tired at the start but by the end I was fine.  Kept the pace easy the entire time."
09/03/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Easy run on the course.  Talked about baseball with Steve Krouse for about the first half hour, then everyone but Dobuol and I went in and we continued for 10 more minutes.  I took a 90 minute nap this afternoon and felt great on the run.  Not looking forward to 6:30 AM practice tomorrow."
09/04/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.50,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Easy run at 6:30 AM on the course.  It was foggy out and we saw the sun rise.  Felt ok.  Ate a big breakfast in the caf afterward."
09/04/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"After about a two hour nap I went for another easy run.  I decided to do a little experiment and am going to see how I feel racing the day after doing some faster stuff.  I did 3 30 second surges and 1 60 second surge at 5K pace with equal recovery.  Drank Endurox after.  Tomorrow should be fun."
09/05/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Race,9.50,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Awesome performance by the team overall...last year we only had 2 guys break 17 and today we had 9 or 10 even with BTW and Pez not running.  I'd say we're looking pretty good."
09/06/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,12.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Did an arb run with Dobuol, Schwock, and Massey.  Pez and Ben Bayer started with us but went back a little early.  I felt fine for about the first hour then my legs felt tired the last couple miles.  Time to start cutting mileage."
09/07/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,11.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"First long workout in several months.  We did it on the gravel roads SW of campus.  I felt alright and made it through the workout fine but afterward I was really tired.  We ran the first two miles of the tempo in a big group, spread out a bit during the next 15 minutes, and then Adrian, Nuss, Massey, and I packed up for the shorter stuff.  Took a three hour nap this afternoon.  This workout brought back flashbacks to a year ago today when after a workout on these same roads I was put on the shelf with stress fractures."
09/08/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,9.50,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran the extended Iron Bridge loop with a group of six.  We ran fairly slow after a night of festivities.  Nothing exciting happened."
09/08/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.50,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran Short Ostrich with Reid.  We ran pretty quick.  It was really humid out.  Did five barefoot strides on the indoor track after.  Feeling pretty tired, don't think I'll be doing any more three day benders any time soon."
09/09/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,12.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Another interval workout on the course.  Ran with Dobuol and Jean Claude Pez Pierre Van Damme Lambert.  Dobuol dropped out about halfway with some breathing issues so Pez and I finished together.  I felt strong the entire way and actually felt better at the end than at the beginning.  The last couple intervals I wanted to open it up a bit but I resisted the urge.  Good confidence booster after Saturday and Monday.  This was our first practice with the entire team - looks like we have 35 guys including about 16 freshmen...I don't know how I'll ever remember all of their names."

It was dumb; this isn't high school, we should be able to pick our own routes.  Nuss, Varley, Paille and I turned around early for eight.  Felt fine, pace was really relaxed."
09/11/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,15.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Long run in the arb(s) with an extension out to the radio tower in the middle.  Ran with Pez, Tumnus, and Rivers for most of the run and then finished with Pez.  Felt alright, good to get a long one in.  Very hot and humid.  After I finished I drank about 50 ounces of water in the next 20 minutes."
09/12/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,9.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Easy run to the Iron Bridge with some of the guys that didn't go to the meet.  Felt pretty tired, didn't sleep very well last night.

09/13/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran Cornhole to Canada with Tumnus at around 4:45.  I remembered how much I love this route in the fall and spring when we can run back through the arb.  Good conversation the entire way and my legs felt pretty good despite waking up at 5:15 AM.  Finished up with a few strides on the indoor track.  Another 90 mile week in the books, now it's time to race!"

09/14/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,12.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Did some 1000s on the prairie loop with a few timed intervals in the middle.  I ran with Pez, BTW, Schwock, and Tumnus (Dobuol didn't do the workout).  The first one was really slow because we couldn't get the pacing down but after that they were right on and I felt strong.  I had the urge to run the last one really fast but Griff told me not to.  The only annoying thing about this workout was Daymont driving a gator around and blowing dust in our faces."
09/15/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,7.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran 50 minutes slow on the course.  Had a sore throat and stuffy nose all day and felt pretty bad on the run.  Before practice 3 time Olympian Jim Spivey gave a 50 minute presentation that I really liked."

I did 2 x 6 min @ tempo effort, 1 x 5 min @ tempo effort, 1 x 2 min @ race effort, 2 x 1 min @ race effort.  I think it was 90 seconds between everything except for the last two intervals, but I don't remember for sure.  Pace was probably slow because I felt really tired."
09/17/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,8.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran Ostrich plus an extension on the course.  Didn't feel that great at the start of the run but gradually got better and felt strong at the end.  I slept over 10 hours last night so that was nice."
09/17/2009,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Had a somewhat epic cross campus run with the entire team.  There was a crowd gathered around the library that witnessed our screaming and then Tumnus hit the sign in front of many witnesses.  Phil and Griff were waiting for us behind the stadium once again to prevent urination.  After the short run we did the 'Last Beer' in the basement of Lincoln Manor.  Despite our team of 35 people we were only able to finish half of a 30 rack of Schmidt because so many people chose to drink lemonade...disappointing.  Feeling better than yesterday but still don't have much energy.  Hopefully tomorrow will be better."

The entire team (including a random kid training for a marathon) started together and then people turned off at various points.

The first mile was supposed to be in 6:30 but Dobuol and I f-ed it up big time and ran a 5:37 instead which kind of screwed up the workout, but whatever.  The third mile was straight into a headwind which was horrible.  Course was somewhat hilly.  I went 5:37, 5:55, 5:40, 5:20, 5:18, 5:10 for a total time of 33:00.  Dobuol and I were together at the turn around but then he ran his last two in 5:05, 4:50.  Felt pretty good during the workout but then on the cooldown my knee locked up.

It would have helped a lot to have someone to run with.

I'm excited for when we put the entire team together in two weeks, it should be good.  It was kind of a 'trip from hell' because Griff missed the exit to the course and then someone locked the keys inside one of the vans so a bunch of people had to run in their trainers (and with other people's chips) on a wet course."

Started off with Dobuol for the first two, then he gapped me on the third one so I ran the last two by myself.  Felt really strong and it was great to put down a hard workout since we really haven't done that many.  The miles all had some sort of hill but none were too bad.  I kind of died the last minute of the fifth one...it would have been nice to break 5 twice, but oh well.  After finishing the 30 second intervals I was very tired and glad to be done.  The last half of the workout was done in a steady rain.  Pretty much everyone ran well today, a good confidence booster for Jim Drews next weekend."

The hill on the backside made things interesting since it came in the last 200 of every 800 and every other 400.  I ran the 800s with Dobuol and in hindsight that probably wasn't a very good idea because I ran them too fast and wasn't able to finish the workout (was supposed to do 2 more 400s and 4 more 200s).  The 8s felt good but by the time we finished them I was already tired and on the 4s I had to work harder than I should have.  The 200s were easy.  Glad this is done, now I get to pull a super late night doing a take home test and getting ready for another in class test."

After the first 20 minutes we did 8 40 second surges randomly spread out over the course of the middle 20 minutes, then had about a 22 minute cool down.  I felt alright, it was nice to take a 2 hour nap this afternoon.  After the workout we went back inside Tostrud and picked up Bro and Gary and took them out to the pond where they got to jump in as punishment for skipping the Press Box Breakfast.  The women's team stole all of our clothes before practice and wore them, but since I didn't turn in any laundry yesterday they didn't get anything of mine."

Tumnus, Rivers, and I went 15, and Josh Wold and Brian Tomlinson ran with us for about the first 65 minutes before heading back.  There was a covering of snow when I woke up and it was cold.  It felt like December.  I felt good for the first 85 minutes and then the last 15 I was ready to be done.  Had a nice long hot shower afterward."

Dobuol took off without me so I ran by myself, which was probably a good thing so that I didn't strain.  At the end of the 6 minute interval we encountered an angry dog that attacked just about all of us.  I panicked and sprinted away...it was one of the most terrifying experiences of my running career.  Bro was not so lucky and got bit on the thigh.  Luckily he's not really hurt, but now we have to hope the dog isn't rabid.  After this incident we decided to change the plan and not run an out and back so that we wouldn't have to go past the dog again.  Instead we turned on 19 and shortly after turned north on Holyoke.  Because of this we were 30 minutes away from school when the workout ended so we got to enjoy a nice long cooldown.  The roads were pretty muddy and we were all quite dirty when we finished.  Overall I felt really strong today and the workout went well...I hope I feel this good on Saturday because if I do it will be a good one."

Dobuol and I ran the mile and the 800s together then instead of doing a 3rd 8 I decided to just do 2 faster 400s.  Ankle was really sore when I got done, I really hope this is just a one day thing.  After the workout we harassed the hell out of Chris Massey and got him really riled up.  I'm still excited for Saturday, not going to let this get me down at all."

Legs felt kind of tired from the race yesterday but the weather was awesome.  Finally a break from dreariness and rain.  This was my last 15 miler of the season, now I'll cut my long runs back a little bit.  I did a projection of the regional meet based on various results from yesterday - I ended up 11th individually and our team was 7th.

Aerobically I never struggled during the workout so I guess that's a good sign.  The first half mile of the first interval was uphill then we went down for a good portion of the rest of it.  By far the easiest sub 5:00 I've ever run, and since I started late I got to chase down most of the team.  The next mile wasn't very fun.  We were supposed to do a 1200 after the mile but I didn't think I had that in me so I cut it out.  During the first 800 I had a really negative attitude and just wanted to stop, and then on the 2nd one I decided to see how fast I could run while keeping it relaxed.  On the way back there was a car in the ditch - Griff saw it happen and said that the guy was driving down the hill way too fast.  The driver also doesn't have a driver's license and tried to flee the scene before Griff convinced him to stay.  I wonder what's going to happen next Monday..."

Did it on the upstairs track because I couldn't motivate myself to run in 30 degrees, wind, and rain/snow.  Changed the plan a little bit but still accomplished about the same thing.  My pace on the last two intervals was around 4:35/mile and it felt really smooth and easy, so I hope I'm finally coming around."

Races

St Olaf Invitational: 27:10, 20th place
Probably shouldn't have even run, I was too sick to compete well and it showed. (C-)

Roy Griak Invitational: 26:38, 22nd place
I put myself in good position but didn't run tough enough in the middle of the race and missed out on the podium by 2 places.  Nonetheless it was a pretty good effort for the first real race. (B-)

Jim Drews Invitational: 25:42, 28th place
Ran tough and was able to run a strong last mile for a pretty big PR on a course that didn't run terribly fast due to conditions. (B+)

MIAC Championships: 25:56, 4th place
Took a chance and competed really well except for a small struggle late.  This was the one race where I really felt I showed what I was capable of...would be an A if we would have won the team title. (A-)

NCAA Regionals: 25:47, 19th place
Let my nerves get to me and I lost my head at the beginning.  Finished at least 12 places lower than I should have but my teammates bailed me out. (C-)

NCAA Nationals: 26:48, 110th place
Not at all what I was hoping for, and not what I was capable of.  Just didn't have it.  The one positive is that I never gave up. (C)

Overall I'd rate my season at about a C+/B-.  The two goals I had coming in were for the team to defend our MIAC title and to be an All American.  Neither one of these was accomplished.  At conference we ran a good race but got beat by a great Hamline performance - we'll 'what if' that race for quite some time I think.  I feel like the training I did through regionals was correct; it was very similar to what I did last spring when I ran really well and going into regions I was feeling really good.  My volume was the most sustained volume I've ever done, and I ran some good workouts.  The last eight days of the season showed how much of an effect your mentality has on racing.  My poor regions race killed my confidence and I never felt the same heading into nationals.  I stopped enjoying running and everything felt harder.  Combine that with having a ton of trouble sleeping for a week and my chances of being All American were virtually 0 before the race even started.  I know that I was capable of it since I was right with Bauer and Sathre at conference and they both made it.  In the future I'm going to need to work on staying relaxed and enjoying the sport for what it is, and on not letting a bad race affect me so much.  This fall gave me more of an appreciation for how good my track season last year was.  Last spring I ran well in every race that I geared up for, and this season despite a summer and fall of great training I was regularly beaten by guys like Haglund and Eckstrom that I never lost to last spring.  For now I'm going to take a little break to recharge my emotional batteries and then start building up for track in hopes of accomplishing my goals there."

Our split at the Highway 3 stoplight was 8:28...close to a minute faster than usual and it didn't feel like we were even running that fast.

Most of the 200s were in 35.x, with a couple 34s and 36s thrown in.  It was easy, just trying to keep the legs somewhat acquainted with race pace.  Ran two more miles upstairs for a cooldown.

It was hard to talk the last half hour, I was definitely slurring my words.  We did three laps upstairs at the end and the last one was really fast.  After the run Phil without prompting told me that on days like this I need to make sure to avoid penile frostbite.  Ha.

I thought briefly about taking the day off but decided I could use a break from my work.  I had no interest in running over an hour upstairs so I fought the cold and darkness outside instead and ran Cornhole to Woodley.  Crossing the iron bridge was a bit treacherous in the dark since it wasn't plowed, but I made it.  Other than being run off the road by cars twice and having a small scare on some ice it was a pretty good run."

Lits and I warmed up outside then came back in and changed; Taylor decided to just run on a treadmill.  We did our workouts on a three lane 11 or 12 lap to the mile track with really tight corners.  There were quite a few other people up there as well including a kid in a wheelchair.  I decided not to worry about actual distance covered and just tried to make the intervals feel like a 5K.

Found out the 3K this Friday is loaded: Hassan Mead, Chris Erichsen, Justin Gruenwald, Willy Kaul, Paul Zdroik, Derek Storkel, a couple other U of M guys, myself, and Bauer.  It's a good opportunity, hopefully I don't get lapped."

Reid ran awesome in the mile and just missed provo, BTW, Tim, and Tomlinson all PRed, and Schantzen had the #5 shot put in the nation.  Mead scratched from the 3K and some of the other fast guys that were entered didn't show up, but it was still pretty loaded.  With 8:36, 8:42, and 8:51 it was the first time in quite a while that 3 Oles have broken 9:00 on the same day."

When I started running I saw people carrying around cases of beer and already starting to pregame for the 100 days march.  I did the usual winter long run route and finished inside.  Felt pretty good the whole time, didn't really feel the race at all.  The meet was ok - Dobuol won the mile but only ran 4:27, we had a couple guys break 2 in the 800, and Perk threw down on the last two laps of the 3K to beat some Carls.  The highlight was probably Will Totimuh running a 6.54 55m in his second track meet ever."

Felt a little better at about 7:00 so I decided to try the workout.  Had to do it on the upstairs track since the golfers were doing something weird downstairs.  I figured out that I needed to run about 52 seconds per lap for it to be 4:40 pace so I did that.  The first two repeats were easy but the last two were pretty hard.  The '200s' were easy as always.  Hopefully the sickness is better tomorrow."

My legs felt really rested (as they should have) and my breathing didn't bother me.  I still have a little bit of a cough but it is significantly better.  Spent the afternoon at Big 10s.  The Badgers won the DMR but other than that didn't have that great of a day and the Gophers had about as close to a perfect day as possible."

Felt alright, didn't feel like my breathing was too hindered.  I still have a cough but otherwise I'm almost back to normal.  Big Tens was cool, in the 5K the top guys went 4:39, 4:34, 4:31 and it didn't look like it was that hard for them.  The Gophers absolutely dominated, congrats to them."

This evening was the annual 'phonathon' where we call a bunch of track alumni and ask them to give donations to the school.  I ended up talking to a Dr from Michigan who said that next fall he wants to talk to Phil about paying for the team apparel order.  Awesome!"

Did Ostrich with an add on in order to get 9.  In the middle I did 10 1 minute pickups with a minute recovery.  Pace was nothing spectacular but it was good to do a little something.  When I got back I opened my computer and Litsheim's race was on the line, so I timed it perfectly.  Then I watched the DMR.  Phil Richert is awesome."

We started off faster than we had planned but I was effortless through 4 miles.  When we turned onto the dirt roads the wind was right in our faces and the sixth mile up the hill was brutal.  Never really opened it up on the last mile but I finished decently.  Definitely could have gone much faster.

Decided to go long today since the Badgers play in the middle of the day tomorrow and I won't want to run then.  I did Chris' loop from last Sunday.  Started out intending to run easier than last week but I finished at about the same pace.  It felt really easy though.  Maybe I should add another mile to my long runs.  Ended the run at the caf because if I showered first I probably would have missed dinner.  After I ate I went and checked the basketball scores and found out I missed the best game of the day in Northern Iowa's upset of Kansas.  Dang it.

Edit: When I was running by the VFW Club downtown an old drunk guy yelled, 'Run bitch, the police are coming!'"

It was 50 degrees and fairly windy which slowed me down a little bit, but that's part of track.  I felt strong through the first 7 intervals, then it was getting pretty hard towards the end.  I really wanted to finish though so I kept at it.  I would have liked to run the last couple a little faster, but overall I averaged about five seconds faster than last year so I'm pleased.  3 x 150 at the end to practice kicking.  Afterward I stayed at practice for over an hour socializing with various people and enjoying the weather."

Should have been able to finish in 5:07 with Dobuol and Adrian, but oh well.  Just need to make it to break and then I can rest up and I'll feel better.  After the run we had an intense discussion about this fall's Alumni 5K.  Griff predicted another perfect score by the team...we'll see about that."

The times aren't terrible, but I had to work hard to get them, and it sort of makes me doubt that I am capable of running a national qualifying time in three days.  My throat is still sore; I can't say it really bothered me while running but it is a drain during the rest of the day.  I'm going to get plenty of sleep and gargle plenty of salt water and hopefully by Thursday I can have this knocked out."

I went out to 313th, hooked up to Canada, and then came back.  It poured for about five minutes towards the beginning but other than that I thought the weather was nice.  Sickness is better than it has been, legs are a little tired but will be fine.  I'm cautiously optimistic."

3.5 mile warmup
4600m of 10K (4:50, 9:21 @ 3K, 5:23ish next mile)

I didn't feel very good on my shakeout or on the warmup, but I told myself that I was fine.  When the race started I was struggling by lap 3, and fell off the pack right after the mile.  The second pack rolled up on me sometime around 3K and I didn't really stick with them at all.  Stepped off at 4600m, disgusted with myself and embarrassed.  Not sure where to go from here in terms of trying to salvage some sort of final collegiate season."

Seeing as I never felt terribly exhausted I'm guessing they weren't that fast.  Overall I felt pretty flat this afternoon and not really in a mentality to really lay down some solid work.  Oh well.  My throat soreness is almost totally gone but I still have a little bit of fatigue.  I might run the 5K at Gustavus on Saturday - not as an all out race, just to get a time in since we're running out of meets.  We'll see."

I feel like I could most likely get a qualifying time if I went to Iowa tomorrow, but I can't say for sure that I would and even if I did I don't really think that I can be competitive at conference.  I can do short easy runs ok, but when I try to do workouts or any sort of longer run there is nothing in the tank.  In addition the concept of trying to race has been really stressing me out and I can't get excited about it.  Running is supposed to be fun, but it isn't when you don't feel strong at all or are out on a run counting down the number of days until you get to take a break.  I'm going to take a few weeks off to get over whatever this virus is that I've been carrying around, and then with a fresh start I'll be able to begin training for my post collegiate career."

There was a mom and two little kids trying to get into Xavier and they came up and tried to get me to help them, but there wasn't really anything I could do.  I felt great for the first 8+ miles then felt a little out of shape for the last 10 - 15 minutes.  Stomach hurt too much to do abs afterward."

Taylor won the state mile in 4:10 and then got 2nd in the 800 in 1:52.  Great double, and Perez finally has another state champ.  Then watched the Oslo meet and saw Rudisha go 1:42.06 before Lagat and Solinsky ran 12:54 and 12:56 respectively.  American distance running has really made a surge over the past year!  When I finally got around to doing my own run I started way too fast because I was so pumped up, which led to a pretty ugly and slow last two miles.  My breathing wasn't really labored but my legs were definitely giving out.  I felt great until then though."

Another nurse came in and figured it out right away.  Overall I got stuck with needles 5 times...not real fun.  I should have the results tomorrow or the next day.

The girl riding jumped off because she was scared, and the mom (still on her horse) chased after the now rider-less horse.  When she caught it (about 15 seconds later) she turned and looked at me and screamed, 'YOU WANT TO STOP RUNNING?'  I stopped and braced myself for a confrontation and she continued to ream me out for 'deliberately scaring her horses' and 'injuring her daughter'.  I let her go for a few sentences before telling her, 'It's a state park, I have just as much right to be here as you.  I didn't do anything to your horse and it's not my fault your daughter jumped off.'  She continued to fume and stomped off in the other direction muttering about how she was going to complain to the ranger, and I continued on my way.  The entire thing was totally ridiculous.

Felt really good for the first 14 miles then my legs got quite tired during the last one.  I guess I can handle feeling tired for one mile.  Finished June with only two less miles than June of 2009, which I'm really happy with considering where I started this month."

Felt surprisingly great.  Afterward as I made dinner and watched TV I was reminded of camp - only I was by myself instead of with 8-10 teammates."

The swim wasn't as hard as I remembered it being the last couple of years.  Later in the afternoon it was raining but I decided I wanted to get a run in so I headed out.  About halfway through it started raining harder and never really let up.  Legs felt ok."

I was way too hungry to run when I finally made it home so I ate an entire pizza instead.  After letting that sit for a couple hours I did an easy 4.  I was tired."
07/06/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.50,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Eight 10 second hill sprints.  A cop watched me do the first three before deciding to move on.  Didn't feel as invincible as when I did these last week but I can't expect that every time.  Little big longer warmup, little bit shorter cooldown.  It was extremely humid."
07/06/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran through downtown Kimberly.  It was really hot and humid so I didn't push the pace.  On the way back there was also a pretty decent headwind.  Something in my lower abdomen has been bothering me for a while, usually just during abs but today it was noticeable while running."

Ran into Mike Brice and ran with him for about 10 minutes before he turned to go home.  Felt good and had a solid pace going until the last mile when I kind of died a bit.  Six strides afterward.  When I finished I looked like I had just come out of the pool."

The pace on the pickups was probably 5K - 3K pace.  Felt pretty good doing them then I was a little tired finishing up the run.  It was a 'lack of sleep' tired though so I'm not concerned."

I wanted 16 but the oppressive heat and humidity continued into today and I headed back to the car a mile early because I could tell that I was pretty dehydrated.  Didn't feel terrible but I never really felt awesome either.  It'd be nice if this heat would break sometime soon."

That turned out to be a good decision because if I had gone when I planned I would have been about halfway through my run when a major thunderstorm/hailstorm started.  Instead I did an extended Xavier loop at about 7:30.  Felt great the entire time.  While running down College Avenue a drunk guy yelled out, 'You should find something better to do than RUN on a F*CKING Saturday night!'.  Ha.  Did seven strides afterward then came inside and watched the Brewers wrap up their win while enjoying some post run pizza and beer."

I put in an old college football game and it actually didn't end up being too terrible.  Kept the pace real easy.  I'm kind of surprised I hit 100 this early in the summer.  Going to Boston on Thursday so I'll frontload this week a little bit."

Felt good to open it up a little bit.  Saw lots of other people out running.  In the afternoon we went to the Bunker Hill Monument and climbed the 294 steps up to the top.  This evening we went to Fenway Park and saw a great game - Red Sox 3 Rangers 2 in 11 innings."

07/20/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,12.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"The usual 12 mile route out at High Cliff.  Felt good the entire time.  About two miles in there was a lady walking down the center of the trail oblivious to her surroundings.  I called out 'Passing on your left' and she jumped and mumbled something that I couldn't understand.  A few minutes later I saw her again and she gave me a really dirty look.  Whatever.  This evening we had an extremely intense storm that only lasted about 15 minutes but covered the front yard in hail and put the back yard under water.  I think we've had more rain this summer than in the past 10 combined."

I felt like a bag of shit on the warmup and thought about canceling the workout but decided to go ahead with it.  Pace was nothing spectacular.  I did the last segment on the Madison Middle School track and split 5:23 through the mile.  Oppressive heat, dehydration, and fatigue from the past couple days contributed to me not feeling real good.  Long run tomorrow morning, hopefully I feel better."

I went out the CE trail to Kaukauna, looped through Combined Locks down by the Appleton Coated plant, came back through Kimberly, and went all the way down to John St.  I felt great through 13 miles.  The last couple I was running out of fuel but I made it.  Didn't realize there were so many hills in Combined Locks.  It was also really humid for 7 AM...I was soaked at the end."

Aleta biked with me so for the first time this summer I had a companion on a run.  Felt good - the best effect of a long run is that it makes the next day's run seem so much shorter.  8 strides afterward."
07/25/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,11.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran out to Kimberly and then added another mile at the end.

The first interval was over before I knew it.  During the tempo I felt like I was running kind of slow but my last mile was around 5:15 and my pace was even so I must have just been feeling good.  The last interval was great, I covered about 1000 meters and felt strong.  This wasn't designed to be super hard but it was the best I've felt during a workout since probably February.  Saw Litsheim heading out for his run as I was bringing in the tempo."

Long warmup beforehand.  I underestimated the difficulty of this by quite a bit - the last two I was really hurting.  Haven't had that much lactic acid in a long time."
08/03/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,11.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran to downtown Egg Harbor and back.  Legs were sore from the hills yesterday but once I got going it was better.

Only had a couple hours rest in between runs and for about the first 7 miles of this one I just wasn't feeling it.  Lots of people in the park today.

I had planned on doing a track workout in the morning but canceled that and instead just did a fartlek around my usual morning loop.

So, I did the first two intervals as timed runs on the road and went over to Madison Middle School.  The track there is a concrete piece of junk, but it served the purpose.  On the first 1000 I started off way too slow, then starting with the second one I was able to find the pace.  Felt like I could keep running this pace for a long time but I didn't feel sharp at all.  I know that in a couple of weeks I'll have more sharpness and the times will easily be several seconds faster.  Overall a confidence boosting workout because I felt very strong."

I slept like crap again last night and there were 18 mph winds, but breaking 10:00 shouldn't be too difficult.  Crossed the mile at 5:02, then my next 200 into the wind was a 39 and I stopped and just jogged home.  The entire time my legs felt like they were spinning close to as fast as they could.  I'm starting to think that I've screwed something up with my training since the majority of the sub tempo pace workouts I've attempted recently haven't gone well.  Either that or I've lost all my toughness.  I'll figure it out eventually."

My aerobic system was never stressed at all and I felt like I had a good pace going.  Definitely was down around 6:30 for the majority of it.  Legs fatigued a bit the last 3 miles but my form stayed together the entire way and I never started dying.  During the second half of the run I thought about my training this summer and how where I'm at now is fairly comparable to where I was a year and a half ago when I was coming back from the stress fracture (aerobically strong but the legs don't have very many gears) - seeing as I haven't done consistent speed work since February I really shouldn't be that surprised by this.  It didn't take long in spring 2009 to get my legs used to running fast again so I'm confident I'll be able to get back into good racing shape...don't have enough time to really change anything before next weekend's 5K but by my races in October I'll be ready to go."

6/1/10 - 8/31/10: 1184 miles (average 12.9/day, 90.1/week)
For these same three months last year I did 1108 miles.  Especially considering where I started June I'm really pleased with this.  My tentative plan is to hover around 90 for the next few weeks, then take it down a little bit to race.  Then I'll probably go back to putting down base, just have to figure out what exactly it will be for."

Did the same thing as last Monday basically - 22 minute tempo and then 4 x 30 seconds hard.  Felt pretty good.  Legs were a little tired, probably partly due to training and partly because I took an Ambien last night.  Also, I'm pretty sure I saw a drug deal going down while I was walking to class."

At about the 55 minute mark I was approaching some guy from behind...he heard me coming and started picking up his pace and looking back every 15-20 seconds to make sure that he was still ahead of me.  After a few minutes of this I got tired of it and just went by him.  I could hear him breathing heavily behind me for another minute or so and then I'm pretty sure he stopped and started walking.

I'd guess I started around 5:30 pace and worked down to 5:15ish, but I don't know for sure (didn't measure the loop).  Did the usual 4 x 30 seconds afterward.  The entire workout I felt really strong and under control.  Now (2 hours later) my legs are dead.

Edit (12/1/10): On this day I actually did start out on a run but a half mile in I decided I was being stupid so I turned around.  Originally I wasn't going to count a 1 mile run, but after some deliberation I've decided that I can count it for the purposes of my streak."

First real run of the fall in tights.  It took me about 3 miles to get going but for the second half of the run I felt decent.  Did 5 pickups during the last 2 miles with the wind at my back.  Off to Northfield this afternoon."

Went to the MIAC meet in the afternoon which went about as well as it could have.  Hamline crushed everyone in the men's race with Monson winning and 4 in the top 6.  The Big O had a good performance and beat St Johns for 2nd...Adrian and Massey made all conference with 3 more as honorable mention.  Everyone definitely put it all out there.  In the women's race Maren and Emma went right after Simone and she looked really uncomfortable having two people right on her shoulder as opposed to running all by herself.  Going up the big hill the three of them were all together, then 2 minutes later on the back straightaway Maren and Emma came around the corner together with Simone nowhere in sight.  Awesome.  They ended up going 1-2 and the team won by a good margin.  All the sprinting I did around the course was definitely worth an extra mile."

Felt really good when I got out there and hammered a good portion of the run below 6 minute pace.  Hadn't had that feeling on a run in a little while.  Ended up being 5 minutes late to my second class since I decided to eat lunch rather than just going straight there."

I stopped at the track in the middle of this run and did 12 150 meter strides with a 250m jog recovery.  Didn't feel fast at all, definitely have some work to do in that area.  I didn't have enough to eat today which combined with my lack of sleep had me feeling pretty weak at the end of the run."

My legs actually felt great on this run but my stomach was bothering me.  Something's been messed up down there for months...I haven't been able to do a sit up pain free since March.  At least it rarely affects me while running and even then it's never really more than just a nuisance."
11/05/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,8.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran over to Grainger to turn in an assignment then headed to the lakeshore trails.  I ended up being really zoned out and took a digger about halfway through.  Didn't hurt anything, just got pretty dirty.  It was 33 degrees this morning with a windchill of 25.  The warm weather was fun while it lasted."
11/05/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran again when I got back to Appleton.  Kept it really easy.  Legs were feeling a little flat, probably because my runs were kind of close together and I ran right after a 2 hour drive."

Did a loop out to Kaukauna and down by Appleton Coated, then looped back to the CE trail and followed that back home, then added my loop over by McKinley that I do before tempo runs in the summer.  Felt great the entire time, honestly one of the easiest runs I've ever done.  It's so much easier to do a long run in 40 degree weather than in 90 degree weather.  Badgers are 8-1...keeping the fingers crossed for a Rose Bowl trip."

Really easy fartlek, just wanted to do something to get the legs moving a little faster.  Over by the Arb I saw Zach Mellon sprinting up a massive hill.  My sickness is better today.

When I got to the track the Badgers CC team was working out so I stretched and did ballistics in a nearby parking lot and waited for them to finish before I went in.

It was a pretty nice route and I was able to run on grass for a decent amount of it.  It looks like the path goes on for quite a ways so I'll have to check it out sometime for a long run.  The first 15-20 minutes my legs felt sluggish but then I felt good the rest of the time.  It's getting colder."

Him: 'How fast you running that 100 meter dash?'
Me: 'Not sure, just doing them a little bit under my max speed.'
Him: 'Well you look pretty fast, I'd say about 9.26 seconds.'
Me: 'Yeah, probably.  That'd be a world record though.'
Him: 'You know in sprinting the key is your arms.  You have to move them back and forth and let them carry your body forward.'

I went out with the idea in the back of my mind that I was going to do this as a progression run, but when I started out I didn't feel that good so I ran easy for the first couple miles.  After that I started squeezing the pace down and after a couple minutes I got into a good rhythm.  Picked it up a little more shortly after the turn around, then at about 6.5 I started feeling it a bit so I backed off for a half mile or so before running another mile and a half hard and then cooling down back to my apartment.  Total time was about 62 minutes, don't know how fast I got going but it felt like a good effort.  Got back in time to see the last couple minutes of NCAAs; Chelanga is a beast."

The recurring sentiment was 'not much,' so since I had a short day scheduled for this weekend I decided to use it today.  Ran on the treadmill while watching the first half of the Badger basketball game.  Legs were good.

This afternoon I saw a doctor to get my stomach checked out since something's been bothering me for quite a while.  He determined that I don't have a traditional inguinal hernia but said it was probable that I have a sports hernia (a torn muscle in the lower abdomen which results in muscle pulling away from the bone).  I was sent to get an MRI...the radiologist wasn't 100% sure since this is apparently a pretty rare injury but it looks like this is what I have.  These things don't heal on their own, but are different from inguinal hernias in the sense that there's no real danger in not operating immediately.  Eventually I'll have to get it fixed, but the problem is that after surgery I won't be able to run at all for about a month and then I'd have to really gradually ease back into it, so it would be 2+ months before I'd be back to any decent training.  My inclination, seeing as I've probably had this for 3/4 of a year already and it hasn't really affected my running, only my ability to do abs, is to put off surgery and run the series of races I'm planning on in the first part of 2011 (culminating in Grandma's) and then go under the knife in the summmer.  The earliest I could have the operation is in January, so I have a while to decide what to do."

Once I got past the first 200 though my legs felt great and I was hitting 31-32 with no problems at all.  Rest was the same as last time, jog a lap (in lane 5) and then wait for the last 30-35 seconds to pass.  For the last one I decided to do a 400 and I didn't tie up at all.  200s are pretty easy to fake, but as easy as this felt I think I might be close to PR shape for the mile."

I made it 46 minutes outside, then did 55 minutes in the shell, then ran back to my apartment.  Physically I felt good the whole way, the conditions outside and the monotony inside made the run a bit challenging mentally.  Most of my running inside was at around 6:10 pace and at 80 minutes I threw in an 80 second 400 just for the heck of it.  Glad to have this one over with.  Going to do two short runs tomorrow.

For the most part the footing was good, definitely a lot better than on the sidewalks in the city.  The first 45 minutes my stomach felt awful, it was like I hadn't digested any of my lunch.

He commented that I looked really fit and asked if I ran for the Badgers.  I did a 30 minute tempo run running clockwise in lane 5 on the indoor track.  Didn't take any splits because running laps around a 200m track is boring enough without looking at your watch every minute or so and being reminded of how much you have left.  I felt pretty strong, didn't really start fatiguing until the last 5 minutes.  3 x 200 with 1 minute recovery afterward in 32.6, 31.6, 31.6.  I honestly have no idea how I used to close races in 28-29, I feel like I'd have to put out basically max effort just to break 30 right now."

My goal on the 600s was 1:42-43 (8:30-35 3K pace) and I made it for the first two (working kind of hard) before falling off on the third.  The 400s felt 50 times easier and the 200s felt better than Tuesday's post tempo 200s.  The shell's policy is to run clockwise on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, but since there were only like 7 people there and everyone else was jogging slowly in the outside lanes I decided to just run counter clockwise in lane 1 so that it would feel more natural."

A section of the path had quarter miles marked off and both times I took a split on the way out I was running six minute pace.  When I turned around I had to head back into a headwind but I didn't end up slowing down all that much.  This afternoon we went to the pep rally with about 35,000 other Badger fans.  It was pretty cool - they showed a highlight video of the season, a bunch of guys from the previous Rose Bowl teams spoke to the crowd, the band played for a while, and then the current team showed up and basically guaranteed victory.

Performance wise in 2010 I didn't have a good year.  I set some PRs during the first part of indoors but then tanked at the conference meet before losing my outdoor season to sickness.  I did two real races this fall and one went horribly while the other was extremely mediocre.  It's disappointing to look back on my races this year because I had big goals and none of them were even close to achieved.  That said, there's nothing that can be done about the past.  Training wise I've done well the past 7 months, and especially the past 2.  Hopefully I've laid the foundation for a return to successful racing in 2011."

First race in quite a while, and while I was shooting for better I'm taking positive things away from this.

Pretty low key workout this week since I'm racing again on Saturday. The 1000s weren't quite as fast as I would have liked but they were better than last week's 800s. Feeling strong, so hopefully my legs can get used to that faster rhythm. The tempo was so easy it felt like I was jogging...I ended up going an extra 400 just because I felt like it. The 400 hurt since it was so much faster than I had just been running, and then the 200s at the end were easy. Cooled down a mile in the shell with Jeremy Berg and then ran back to my apartment."

Not happy with myself. Long story short there was a rabbit in the field that took everyone out super hard, I went straight to the back and tried to just hang on but ended up getting gapped after 800. Soon after that I slowed down considerably. Brill lapped me with around 700 left, then a lap later I could tell a couple other guys were coming and I just stepped off the track because I was embarrassed. Not proud of it, but I have to live with what I did. I just didn't belong in this race...I was trying to run low to mid 8:30s and everyone else was shooting for low 8:20s or faster.

I'm pretty pleased with this one. The pace felt easier than the past two weeks and while I was tired at the end I had a little bit left in the tank. The first 1200 I would have been under 3:30 except that on the last lap a kid chasing a basketball ran out in front of me and I basically came to a stop. On the second 400 I forgot to start my watch. These splits are fairly comparable to a workout I did last year right around the time I ran 14:53, so I should be able to run pretty close to that if I race next weekend.

When the race started I wasn't feeling it and fell off my planned pace after about 800.  After about halfway I was really struggling and felt like I was going to fall over at any moment, it was comparable to the 5K I ran at Gustavus last April.  Chris passed me at 2200 and I pretty much just cruised it in...I think my time was like 9:15.  I don't know why I felt so terrible, at least it was only the Alumni 3K and not something that actually matters.  Back to training for a while, next race will be in April."

Did it as a double out and back so that I could stay in an area that was relatively clean.  Felt pretty good almost the entire time, but when I finished my back and hamstrings were pretty sore.  My jacket was covered in ice at the end."

I did 25 minutes in lane 5 and was on 5:20-25 pace the entire time.  Felt surprisingly good for how little sleep I've been getting and my pulse was about 156 when I finished so there was definitely more in the tank.  3 x 200 after in 31.5, 32.5, 31.1.  Towards the end of the workout I took my shirt off because I was getting hot...about one lap later some worker came over and told me I needed to put it back on because 'people running on the track need to be wearing shirts'.  Inside the track there are four basketball courts and people play shirtless all the time.  I pointed this out and he said that he didn't make the rules, he just enforced them.

Got the idea for this workout from Nate Jenkins' blog...he does a set of 30 but that's a little bit much for me.  Legs feel like they've been through the meat grinder...if I'm going to run this much I need to get more than 6 hours of sleep per night."

After how tired I was this morning I wasn't sure how this workout was going to go so I went into it with no expectations and ended up feeling about as good as possible considering what I was doing.  I suppose it's always good to work on your weaknesses.  My wish for a week from now: that the snow would melt off of the outdoor track."

It was pretty easy for the most part; on the last interval I started off a little slow so I picked it up in order to hit the time but that was the only part of the workout that felt a little pressed.  5:05s is 67 minute half marathon pace...is that doable in three months?  Farewell to the indoor track, barring a storm that makes running outside impossible I won't be back until December."

When I finally got out there I started off fast from the get go and after a mile decided to just run as fast as I could while staying in control.  Hammered for eight miles then did the last two miles easy as a cooldown.  Felt great the whole time.

It snowed last night, but only like an inch so for the most part things weren't too bad.  Left hip and groin were feeling it by the end."

There's tons more snow in Appleton than in Madison or Northfield.  My legs felt alright, I hadn't had much to eat since dinner yesterday so I didn't expect to feel great.

Hit the first two how I wanted, fell off on the third one, and said that if I couldn't get back on it on the 4th I was going to stop.

Just have to remind myself that I'm super fit and a couple down days won't do anything to change that.  I ran Picnic Point and felt ok.  Took a nap in the afternoon."

It was only about 35 degrees out so it wasn't comfortable.  When I got back to my apartment I was frozen.  Even more frustrating was that I couldn't get any hot water when I was showering.

The rests were what made this hard...I did it as a continuous run and most of the recovery intervals were right around 50 seconds.  Threw in the longer break halfway to ensure that I could finish at the pace I wanted.  It would have been real nice to have someone running this with me.  Breathing was never a problem, legs got real tired.  Based off of this I should be able to break 15 on Saturday but I'll have to have my head on straight."

When I stopped my leg totally locked up and I had to walk home.  I'm at a loss for how to handle this...I've had pain in several different spots in my upper leg and hip and nothing I've tried works with any sort of lasting effect.  I guess I'll just stick to the bike for the next couple days and hopefully I can get looked at when I go home this weekend."

I stretched and did core so at least I did a little something.  No more days off this week."

Effort wise I only put out about a 5/10...probably should have pushed a little harder but I still felt like I accomplished something and since I'm sleep deprived it was probably best not to try to kill it.  There was some pretty intense lightning towards the end of the workout and on the cooldown.  Also, my dinner tonight consisted of a bowl of rice because the chicken breasts I was going to make were spoiled and I have no other food.  Need to fix that."

I felt ok starting out but the last 20 minutes I was definitely stuggling; not sure how much of that was due to being out of shape and how much was due to doing a 16 mile day after basically not eating dinner last night and getting less than 5 hours of sleep.

When I started out it was pretty warm, then when I got to College Ave the temp dropped about 15 degrees, the wind picked up, and the skies got dark.

The heat just kicked my butt...I already wasn't feeling good at the mile and ended up taking short breaks at four and six because I was getting light headed.  Then with about two miles left I swallowed some bugs and spent the next half mile coughing them up.  Finished with a few strides and at least those felt pretty good."

I did 8 45 second hills with two 30 second strides both before and after.  It was a hard workout but I felt alright the whole time.  Finished feeling good about it.  The downside to this heat is that I don't do any supplementals when I get back because I'm disgusting and uncomfortable and just want to get in the shower.  At least it's supposed to cool off tomorrow."
08/03/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,12.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran two miles by myself then met up with Phil to run 10.  He kept cranking the pace down to sub 6:00/mile.  My legs aren't ready to do training runs that fast so at an hour I finally told him to go on without me.  Once I slowed down I finished up feeling just fine.  Kind of demoralizing since I don't think I've been dropped from a run in about three and a half years, but it's not necessary to pound it that fast."

I think I ran this workout pretty much perfectly...found the tempo rhythm and once my breathing settled down after a minute or two I ran pretty smooth the whole time.

I ran on the Root River Trail in Lanesboro...this is the only running option in this city so thankfully it's about 40 miles long.  Aleta biked with me.  My legs felt kind of flat and I felt depleted of energy so I was glad it was only a 7 mile run.  It was also getting kind of warm...need to get up earlier for the long run tomorrow.  Had 4 scrambled eggs with tomatoes and spinach afterward."

Energy wise I was fine and my legs held up pretty well throughout as well.  I got up at 8 and got going around 8:30 and the weather was a little cooler this morning which was great.  Best week of training in a long time, hopefully I can keep it going."

Some of the other guys decided to just go run easy and I decided that I would just do 4 x 5 minutes on the trails.  At the end of my first interval I ran into a group doing 1000s on a loop in the woods and I decided to join them, figuring that I would get a better workout.  They were doing 5 repeats so I hopped in for the last 4.  The loop was tough; I'd say comparable in difficulty to the last 1000 of the 4th mile on the old course at St Olaf.  I ended up hitting about the same pace that I had hoped to do the miles in and I figure that doing the the repeats on hilly trails instead of the track cancels out the fact that they were shorter.  My legs didn't have a lot of zip but I felt alright and was able to recover in between intervals.  To do this with 31 miles in my legs from the past 2 days tells me that I'm doing alright."
08/10/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,12.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Started this run at 8:40.  I ran so late because I did some errands after work and forgot a bag of stuff at the checkout at Target so I had to go back to the store.  For the first six miles it seemed like the run was taking forever and I thought a couple of times about just taking a shortcut back to my place, but around halfway I got into a good rhythm and ended the run feeling good.  It was about 61 degrees out this evening with zero wind and a full moon...absolutely amazing weather.  Ran on the Wingra trail."

I was only planning on staying for a little while but I was having fun so I just stayed the whole time.  Then I went home, had a light snack, and set off on the run.  As usual I tempoed on the southwest bike path.  Did 24 minutes and felt great the entire time.  Not sure what the pace was but it felt like I was cruising.  Last mile might have been close to 5:10.

Capitol City Trail out and back.  It was about 75 degrees which was great, felt a little warmer because of the sun though.  On the way back I had a decent headwind pretty much the whole way.  There were a ton of bikers out.  I felt fine the whole run minus the usual feeling of 'man I still have 5 more miles to go' when I was 10 miles in."

Started off going to Walgreens to return a Redbox movie and then headed to Picnic Point and the lakeshore.  My stomach felt terrible from the pizza for the first 3 miles or so.  On my way back towards the end of the lakeshore path a cop car was blocking the trail and three or four cops were searching the woods for something.  Finally rolled over 2000 miles for the year...only took 150 days from when I got over 1000.  Hopefully no more injuries for the rest of the year."

I didn't run very fast, but seeing as I've only been running for a little over a month I'm doing alright.  After the first interval I think I split all of the others something like 75/73; it was weird.  This should indicate sub 16:00 shape."

Probably for the better that it worked out this way since I don't think any part of this run was under 7:00 pace.  My pace on my non workout days is the thing that's really lagging in my return to fitness.  It'll come around eventually."

This week I did 4 x 6:30 cruise intervals with 75 seconds recovery...I split it up like this since I'm running a race in less than 36 hours and I want to give myself at least a chance of feeling decent.  The workout was pretty easy; didn't feel real pressed and I was recovering really quickly in between reps.  Finished with four 30 second strides."

Gonna be criss crossing Wisconsin and Minnesota for the next 2+ weeks."
08/20/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Tempo,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"5K at the Madison Mini Marathon.  The race was supposed to start at 7:00 but at 6:55 as I was finishing my strides they made an announcement that the start would be delayed because of incoming weather.  I was frustrated for a minute but it ended up being a good decision because by 7:15 it was storming pretty bad and they would have had to blow the horn.  Finally at 8:15 they told us the race would start at 8:30.  Since it was a meaningless race and warming up in 15 minutes isn't possible I jogged a mile and decided that I would just run it as a harder tempo run.  Ended up finishing in 17:31 for 3.3-3.4 miles, not sure what the exact distance was (I clicked it out online yesterday and got 3.4, the guy behind me ran with a GPS and got like 3.32).  So something like a 16:10-16:15 5K.  Another guy went out ahead of me at the start but I passed him in less than 5 minutes and ran the rest solo.  It was raining pretty hard for most of the time I was running and then about 5 minutes after I finished the rain let up.  It's always fun to win a race and have people cheering for you.  Felt like I was tempo running the entire time, so that's a sign that I'm in halfway decent shape.  After I finished I went back to my apartment and showered and then went back down to get my free post race beer and watch the end of the half marathon.  Should be ready to put the hammer down in 2 weeks."

The first mile was fine.  Pacing on the tempo was kind of sloppy and probably a little bit slow...seems like I always have that problem when I try to do tempo stuff after starting with hard intervals.  I got it together by the second half.  On the last mile I was really hoping to see a sub 5...I was on pace at halfway and then felt like I was pushing hard coming in but I ended up at 5:02.  The humidity has returned; I was drenched at the end.  Short cool down since we were going out for dinner for my grandma's birthday.  I was cashed anyways."

My legs felt like I was running on air and my breathing would always get back to normal pretty quickly after each repeat.  A Lawrence campus safety vehicle drove down the hill and sat in the parking lot for a few minutes; at one point I was a little worried that he was going to try to tell me I couldn't run there (it's a public road so he doesn't have that authority), but then he left."

This run took place just over an hour after eating lunch at Das Wurst Haus (huge brats that were really good, the only beer they had on tap was La Crosse Lager but I didn't have one) so I didn't know how my stomach would feel but I didn't have any problems.  Felt great the whole time and ending up picking up the pace significantly on the way back and negative splitting by 2 minutes.  I'm always amazed by the number of people that are biking on this trail; I don't think I've ever seen another runner though.  The last 10 minutes I started getting pretty thirsty and when I finished I chugged a 32 oz Gatorade."

When I started this run I was pissed off (conflict with the P.U.) but I realized that pounding the run wouldn't help anything and would just make me feel worse for tomorrow's tempo and Saturday's race so I refrained.

After about a mile and a half my body just wasn't having it any more; I had major hunger pains and felt like I was going to faint.  Jogged slowly home.  This isn't a good time for my first bad workout in a while but I'm going to try to just shake it off.  A couple good meals should fix things."

It was only like 60 degrees out which I suppose is kind of appropriate for the last day of summer.  The last 20 minutes an older guy was biking about 100 meters behind us...he never passed but instead just sat there.  By the end of the run it was kind of starting to creep me out."

Wasn't sure going in how tough it would be...I'd say the difficulty ended up being about a 7 or 8 out of 10.  I was pretty aggressive on the one minute intervals and then I'd like to think that I ran about a 5 minute mile finishing up.  I'm still not sure if I'm going to do any more races this fall but either way doing some workouts now will have benefits in the winter and spring."

Not sure why my motivation was so lacking, other than that I was just generally tired.  Finally at 6:30 I suited up and headed out to at least get something in.  Pretty quickly I decided that I would just do tomorrow's long run tonight.  It was a pretty cool run doing the first half as the sun was setting and the second half under the moon light.  The temperature also dropped from 80 degrees at the start to 66 degrees at the end.  Saw a few deer, one of which was no more than six feet away from me at one point.  From about miles 4 to 14 I felt invincible and like I could run forever.  The last little bit my legs were alright but my core was getting tired.  This was my longest run in six months...I'm making progress."

Spent the run thinking about what happened 10 years ago...it doesn't seem like it happened yesterday but it doesn't seem like it's been 10 years either.  God Bless America."

I still have a ways to go to get back to tip top shape, but today I felt fairly controlled for the most part.  My goal was somewhere between 8 and 10 repeats...the last 150 of the 7th one I hit a little bit of a wall but I convinced myself to do another, then after feeling alright on the 8th I figured I'd keep going.  When I started hitting it with 300 to go on #9 I decided to push that one in and call it a day."

Ran through a bunch of different neighborhoods with her for about 70 minutes then added about 15 more on my way home.  I'm pretty sure I'm taking tonight off so all of the day's running was done by 8:45.  Great 50 degree morning, great way to start the day."

Late morning workout.  For a change of venue I decided to do this in the arb rather than on the bike path.  The tempo felt pretty good; the arb is pretty rolling so it kind of felt like cross country.  For the last 5 minute interval I was back on the road and I honestly would be surprised if I ran much slower than a 4:50 mile because I felt like I was really cruising.  Started out fast and tried to just maintain it.  Another good workout in the bank."

I jumped the fence to get onto the track, and in doing so I ended up with a small cut on my thigh that will probably leave a scar when it heals.  The 400s were done as a continuous run...I wasn't tired at the end but they felt fast.  I don't know if it's the 109 miles in the past week or what but I don't think I could have run a relaxed 4:40 mile tonight.  Oh well, it'll come.  The 150s felt good.  Ended up doing a long cool down because I bumped into Mike Brice and Alex Hatz and turned around and ran with them for a bit.  Once I hit 35 minutes I walked the last half mile home because I figured I had run for long enough."

8 x 50 seconds hard (jog back rest)

Skipped the morning run.  I kind of wish I hadn't, but if I was tired enough to sleep two more hours I suppose I needed the extra sleep more than the miles.  The workout this afternoon was good.  Pacing on the tempo was pretty much dead even and on the intervals I got the hard effort that I was looking for.  The intervals alternated between flat and uphill...they all started from the same point and the rest was a jog back (I tried to keep this jog close to a normal run pace rather than a shuffle).  On the warmup I stopped at the UW Business Office to pay my tuition for the semester, so now I'm poor."

I ended up cutting the second tempo section at 12 minutes because I felt terrible, then did a 3 minute interval, took 2 minutes rest, and did a 2 minute interval.

I did six Picnic Point repeats last fall and averaged right around 4:00, so I decided to do it again this year and see how I compared.  On the warmup I was actually a little bit nervous for this; not sure when the last time I was nervous for a workout was.  The trail is pretty hilly and somewhere between 1250 and 1300 meters long.  I ran 3:50, 3:55, 3:57, 3:55, 3:58, 3:57.  I was shocked that I ran 3:50 on the first one because for some reason I thought it was going to be like 4:05.  I knew that this wasn't sustainable for six repeats to I slowed it down a bit for the second one.  Unfortunately I ended up slowing down a little more on the last couple...maybe if I hadn't run the first one so fast I would have been able to finish faster.  The 1 minute and 30 second intervals basically served to simulate the discomfort of the last 1000 meters of a race.  I was pretty dead when I finished but I don't think I over reached.

2 mile morning shakeout...I liked it before last Tuesday's workout so decided to do it again."

It was a little bit weird because there are only about 15 people still on the team that I ran with and half of them weren't there.  Ran mostly with Tim, Saksa, and Grant, and Stretch and Block were around for a little while.  We had to repeat a lot of the same paths because there were only about 4 miles worth of trails, but for one run it was a nice new location.  Tim and Saksa pulled off at 90 minutes and Grant and I finished up with about 12 more, where we ended up picking it up a bit.  I didn't get tired until the add on.  Good to see some of the guys, and the drive up and back with Phil was fun as always."

I've done this workout (or pretty similar variations of it) a couple times the weeks of big cross country races and usually felt real good the day of the race so I'll try it again.  I felt great tonight.  14 minutes of intervals with rests is a lot different than a 5 mile race, but if I can continue to keep this rhythm through the week I might actually run pretty well on Saturday.

There was one low spot at the bottom of a hill that was totally flooded...I saw a car go speeding into the puddle and it looked like Splash Mountain.  On the way back by Tenney Park some guy was walking towards me with his jacket covering his face.  He didn't move out of the way at all and I figured he didn't see me so I went on the grass.  I ended up scaring the crap out of him and he whipped around as if he was getting ready for a confrontation.  I just kept running and he yelled after me, 'Yeah, keeping running, you f*cking idiot!'"

My legs were tired and the intervals weren't quite as easy as I had expected/hoped, but 2 minutes of rest is quite a bit and I felt like I was recovering pretty fast.  I wish the days didn't get shorter as we got closer to winter; I started this run at 5:00 and finished the last 2 miles in the dark.  Next week with daylight savings time it will be dark even earlier so I'll need to adjust my schedule seeing as I haven't started an afternoon run before 4:30 in weeks."

This has been a pretty dense past seven days of training with 112 miles, a race, two workouts, and a long run.

This was really easy and I felt good the whole time.  The pace was solid; going by feel I'd say maybe around 5:10.  This might have been the last real nice day of the fall before the temperature drops...I'll hope not but looking at the forecast I might be done running in shorts and a t shirt until March."

Feels like I'm getting nice and strong aerobically.  My abdomen was really bothering me on the cool down...haven't felt anything down there for a few months but I guess I still have that sports hernia.  Hopefully it doesn't affect tomorrow's long run.

The next four days I will be significantly reducing mileage.  My thought/hope is that taking this little break will help me stay fresh until February, and this weekend is a good time to take it with a job interview in St Paul tomorrow, my cousin's wedding on Saturday, and the Packer game on Monday."

The plan was to do 4 sets of 3-2-1 but if I had done a 4th set I would have only had about a half mile cool down, so since I didn't want to have to extend the run I just did the 4 minute interval and called it a day.

Speeding up over 1 second per lap per repeat made it tougher I think.  The last one I was 5 seconds off pace at 1200 and was working really hard so I stopped.  It was a weak moment mentally; I wish I would have just gutted out two more laps even though the time would have been slower than planned.  Nonetheless I certainly couldn't have done this workout last winter and I don't know that I could have done it two years ago either as I don't think I would have been as relaxed on the first 3, so I'm making progress.

I drove down to St Olaf to do this workout since there aren't any indoor tracks in the Twin Cities that I can get on. The 1000s didn't go very well. I've got plenty of possible excuses for why, but I was definitely working harder than I anticipated. The 300s actually felt fairly good.

Not an exceptional performance but I am ok with this. I ran faster than last year (second fastest time ever) and considering that yesterday I didn't even want to run this race it was a good effort. Got out hard...just let the front guys go and I ran with the second pack. I was running well through the mile but then threw in a couple 36+ second laps that really hurt my time. With some more workouts and another race or two under my belt I'll be more ready to ride the red line. I feel like I'm close to a breakthrough; just have to stay on course and keep believing.

I produced another one of my typical races that has been the story of my past 2 years of running. We started off hitting 34s which was what I was hoping for. I felt fine through 1K but by halfway I was in trouble and then the last 1200 or so I totally fell apart. I took out some frustration on the last lap and JV kicked a Hamline guy. Even dealing with some sickness the past 10 days there's no way I should run this slow, and it's especially baffling because of how good my legs have felt the past few days. Even on the warmup I felt great and like I was ready to rock. I'm not sure where my running will go from here. I can't keep doing this to myself.

Since I started this run less than 10 hours after finishing last night's workout I also decided to keep it to 15.  It was lightly snowing but there was no real accumulation yet.

I originally had this workout scheduled for Thursday with six intervals but had to slide it back.  I was hoping I would be able to do four intervals today but after the first one I decided that three would be a better decision.  I'm not sure what my pace was since I used a different course.  The last time I did cruise intervals I was running 5:00-5:10 but there's no way I was that fast today.  Probably closer to 5:15-5:20.  My cough is getting better (although still present), but mainly I just felt really weak and out of gas.  After the last one I just wanted to lie down and sleep.  I haven't had much of an appetite all week so that's probably why.  Hopefully I'll be feeling stronger for Tuesday's workout.  It was nice to run in shorts and a t shirt.  66 degrees!

After the run I watched the D3 national 5K and saw Tim Nelson absolutely kill it. He blasted away from the pack with 1200 left and ran a 2:42 last 1000 to win in 14:11.  It took 14:28 to make All American which is crazy.  Then I looked at Adrian's and Jack's logs and saw that they both went 20 today.  Nothing like following up a less than stellar workout by getting further demoralized by everyone else's great efforts.  I've got 8 days to get ready for Human Race."

I was hoping to hit about 3:00 and I was a bit off of that, but I didn't fall off badly and I'm definitely not back to 100% with my breathing yet so it wasn't terrible.  I ran at Macalester and it was great to work out on the outdoor track.  I got mixed up about where some streets actually were, hence the long warmup.

Lesson learned: pounding a 10 miler the night before a workout is not a good idea, especially if you also still have a race in your legs.

I finished my warmup, ballistics, and strides and as I was getting set to start the baseball coach came over and told me I had to leave.  After protesting a bit I got in my car and drove to SPA.  Jogged a minute or so and did a stride then got going.  On the 1000s my breathing always felt in control; my legs just can't go faster.  This summer I'm going to do lots of 100s and 200s to fix this lack of speed.  The 200s felt good, although it's humbling to think that Levins and Lawi ran that pace for a 5K last weekend."

Several (if not most) of the mile markers were misplaced so I'm not sure of splits but I was 27:12 at their 5 mile.

Abslutely perfect running weather and a pretty nice course.

Edit (10/16/2013): I suppose I should log this as a race since after 2 failures at the TC10 this is the fastest 10 mile I've ever run (although I split faster in both of my half marathons).  This really did feel like a workout effort when I did it though."

As we turned onto River Road there was a guy a little ways ahead of us that on first glance I thought looked like Tim Lillehaugen, so I dropped the pace a bit to catch up.  Sure enough it was Tim.  He ran with us up Summit and then turned off at Macalester.  It was a pretty quick run but I felt good and I don't have any workouts planned so it's no big deal.  Afterwards a group of us went to Plum's and I ended up playing darts and drinking PBR until 2 AM with Branigan, Nate, and Paul."

Only saw one other person in there.  Felt decent the first 2/3 of the run but by the end I was hungry, thirsty, and sweaty.  It'd be great to get some nice 75 degree summer days, but it doesn't look like there are going to be any of those anytime soon.  Maybe I should move to Maine."
07/16/2012,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,13.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Nice run on the river road.  Started early so the temperature was relatively cool, which probably explains why my legs felt better.  Having to get ready for work right after banging out a 90 minute run isn't very fun though."

I got the idea for 3x3x400 from Dan last night and then added the 2 miles at the beginning to get a bit more volume in.  The whole workout was basically at threshold effort but it was great to get some running in at different paces.  By the last set of 400s the 30 second rest was starting to pass pretty quickly.  There was a decent headwind in the last 100 so most of the intervals were positive split.  It's good to know that I'm still in pretty good shape even though I haven't done much quality in the past month."

Pretty much all of them were between 32.5 and 32.9; I couldn't go any faster without pressing so I just kept it there.  The last one felt the same as the first so I guess that's good.  Definitely have no speed...if I raced a mile right now I wouldn't be under 4:30.  I'm going to try to do something like this a couple more times over the next few months in order to change that."

Matt Brutger caught up to me near the Arb exit so we ran together for a few minutes.  I was supposed to do a double today but decided to watch the US basketball game this morning instead and then our evening plans ended up stretching out way later than intended so I ended up scrapping it instead of doing a run at 11 PM.

I knocked this workout out of the park.  Didn't get to start until about 8:30, but from the first steps my legs felt really good.  Cruised through the first three miles at around 5:18 pace, then either maintained pace or dropped it a few seconds for the rest of the first segment.  During the rest I still felt really fresh and I knew my second segment would be fast.  It was basically a 10 minute 2 mile.  Considering I'm very stressed out right now I definitely did not see this coming.  Taking the miles down last week obviously helped.  Part of me is wondering if I should keep my mileage at 85-90 and make sure I'm almost always fresh for workouts."

I only took 8 days off during these 12 months...2 for sickness, 2 because I just needed a day off, and 4 for end of season recovery after my half marathon.

FML.  I've had plenty of bad performances in my post collegiate career, but excluding my 17:30 at the 2011 Alumni 5K when I was out of shape this one takes the top spot.  This was not fun and makes me really question whether or not I should keep doing this.  I am tired of working my butt off and getting into great shape (at least what I think is great shape), only to show up at a race and run a time that I wouldn't have been happy with 3 years ago.  I've said a couple of other times this year after poor performances that I might be ready to hang up the shoes...I didn't then and I probably won't now, but it might be time to give up the idea of trying to be an 'elite' runner and just do it for fun.  I really enjoy training, but for the majority of the past few years racing has given me disappointment and depression rather than pride and happiness.  I wouldn't be surprised if with today's performance I ran myself off of the club nationals team...we'll see what Mortenson says about that later this month and if I make it I'll go, if not I probably won't be racing again until 2013.  For now I'm going to take a little time off and let whatever's going on in my shin/calf heal.

I felt good during the tempo...pace was obviously a little slower than it would be on dry pavement but for this time in the year that's fine.

Got the year started on the right note! The time won't win any medals or scare anybody, but this race was all about competing. Warming up I felt like I was just out on a run and not getting ready for a race. Strides were nice and smooth. The race started and after 200 meters it was obvious that nobody wanted to be the one to take the lead and set up a fast time. The U of M guys were at the front and I was in about sixth. At halfway I started to move up, and somehow ended up in the lead for about 150 meters before four guys went back around. Our third quarter must have been around a 70, as everybody was running with the brakes on. Things started to take off with 400 to go and coming up to the bell I didn't know if I would have a kick, but with about 175 left I found another gear, got by all four guys that were ahead of me, and ran the last 50 knowing that I had it. For the first time in three years I ran a race on the track that I was really happy with. I wasn't all that close to my PR, but the race didn't set up for that and seeing as it's January 12th and I've done one track workout that's fine. And although I know they're not at their best right now I beat Lachowitzer (14:17 5K PR) and Macon (MN state champ in the mile last year in 4:12). Afterwards I had some really bad track hack."

Cool-down: 

Worked out at the U with Nick and Jordan Zwick. The original plan was 4 x 1000 + 2 x 400 and I thought it was going to be really tough. I paced the first one (shooting for just under 3:00) and felt strong and smooth, and pretty much knew from that point that I'd have a good day. On the next two we were supposed to surge the 3rd 200. We did, but the surges weren't anything special...34s or so. After the 3rd K I decided I'd do 5 since I was still feeling really good. On the last one I was 2:22 at 800 and then closed in a 30 (that was planned). Nick then asked if I wanted to jump in a 400...I still felt alright, so why not? 65 felt (dare I say) easy. This is my best track workout since college and stacks up well with some of the better ones I've ever done. It was great to run it with other people; I've got to do that more often. Big confidence boost for the race next week."

The 6 to 10 inches of snow that is on the way will not make things any better.

Past 4 weeks: 80, 70.5, 81, 83.  Not great volume, but I'm fit, I'm totally healthy, I'm excited for the spring, and the training I've done the past two months is something I can build off of rather than a cycle that has me peaking now.

� Despite a mediocre performance it�s cool that I finished 10th in a race with 20,000 participants.
� It�s somewhat depressing to think that I ran a time similar to today�s 5 years ago at outdoor conference, and 4 years ago I ran almost a minute and a half faster.
� This is the second time in six months that I�ve raced a 10K off of about five weeks of actual training.  I ran 33:28 at Club Nats in December�considering the difference in terrain the performances are probably about equal, but I ran quite a bit harder in Kentucky.  I�m hoping that I can stay healthy and don�t get the opportunity to try this a third time.
� I forgot to pack a singlet and had to buy one this morning at the expo for $10.  I can no longer make fun of Chris Massey for forgetting his stuff.
� This was the first time I raced against Tyler Morey since high school, and the first time I�ve ever beaten him.
� In 2 weeks in Duluth I am going to have to go out very conservatively.  Last year I got sucked out in about 10:00 for the first two miles.  This year I need to be out no faster than 10:20, and 10:30 might even be better.  It�s going to take one of the better performances of my life for me to crack 1:08 seeing as that's the pace I ran for 10K today, and even splits is the only way I�ll be able to do it.

Only 5 of our 7 guys showed up to race so I had to finish in order for us to get a team score; otherwise I probably would have dropped out.  I can't believe I lost to some of the people that beat me.  I'm glad I did that 10K last weekend so I at least got one good effort in before TC10.  What happens in 2 weeks will pretty much entirely determine whether this cycle was a success or a bust.  So far very little of it has been positive."

For all the rain during the week the course was not in too bad of shape.  Then the women ran first.  Noelle ran awesome and got 2nd.  She was basically right with the lead pack the entire race and then was the last one to fall off the St Scholastica girl.  The rest of the Olaf girls kind of struggled, but they're a young team and they'll have a couple more opportunities.  It felt like forever until the men's race started.  It was sunny, but with temperatures in the 30s and the wind it was kind of cold for standing around.  Since our guys had the box on the far right side I was nervous about the hairpin turn at 500 meters, but when they came back all of them were in good spots.  Just like last week Eli Horton was out front pounding, but Grant and Jake Brown were right around the top 10, Saksa wasn't far behind, and Calvin and Jake Campbell were in the 40s.  We held our spots for the first 10 minutes, and on the loop between 2 miles and 5K it looked like we were in control of the race as the NCC pack was still stuck behind our 4 and 5.  Phil asked me how we were looking and I told him that if we held our spots we would win.  The last 3K was probably the most excited I've ever gotten watching a cross country meet.  NCC was starting to roll, and every time I saw the pack I could tell that our lead was shrinking.  With 2 minutes of running left it was a tossup, but the guys were able to dig deep and slam the door.  Grant held off Eli for 3rd and Jake ended up 8th so we had the two low sticks that we needed.  Saksa was in 25th when he passed me with 500 to go; he finished 17th.  Jake Campbell got by 3 guys in the last straight, including NCC's #3, to finish 31st (one week after placing 18th at regionals, and two months after placing 31st overall and 8th on the team at the St Olaf Invite).  Calvin was hurting (he's been injured and hasn't been running much), but he did what he had to do and got across in 65th.  Phil and Dillon did well too - 75th and 122nd.  Right after the finish people (including the guys who ran) kept asking me if we had won, but I thought it was too close to call and didn't want to give out wrong information.  There was tension in the air as we all waited for the scores to be posted...it only took about 5 minutes but it felt like a half hour.  Finally it came up: St Olaf 84 North Central 86.  NATIONAL CHAMPS!  At that point the party was on.  After about 20 minutes of screaming, hugging, texts, and phone calls a bunch of us went out and did a 10 minute cool down.  The awards ceremony followed: the 4 All Americans got their medals, the guys went up and got the gold trophy, and we closed it down by taking a picture of the whole Olaf group and singing the fight song.  First national team title in any sport in school history.  I knew it was a possibility but thought it was more likely that we'd be 2nd.  On my way home as I walked through the airport wearing my National Champions hat a bunch of random people said congrats, which I accepted on behalf of the team.  On the list of best days of my life today is definitely in the top 10...even though I'm not on the team anymore I feel like my group laid the groundwork for this.

I didn't think that I would ever run a course more difficult than nationals in 2009, but that course looks like Eau Claire in comparison to this one.  It certainly didn't play to my strengths as a runner, and without having done really any race specific or anaerobic training I knew going in that there was pretty much no chance of a great race.  Basically I just wanted to give it as good of an effort as I could.

At the start I didn't get out super hard and I ended up getting stuck pretty far back.  I ran most of the first lap in a crowd with my hands up and came to almost a complete stop on several turns.  I'd guess I was in 220th-230th after 2K.  After this I fell into a pattern of struggling up the hill then trying to both recover and pass people on the rest of the loop.  I saw a bunch of people fall, and on a lot of the downhills my main focus was on staying upright.  I just was never able to make the big move that I needed to.  The highest I got was probably around 180th.  With two laps to go I glanced down at my feet and noticed that I had lost one of my chips and that the other one was loose, so from then on I kept checking about every 10 seconds because I knew that if the second one fell off I had to go back for it.  Pat Parish passed me the last time up the hill.  Once I got through the sketchy footing part of the downhill finish I was able to get him back.  

Three days later I'm still not sure how I should feel about my performance.  I placed in a slightly higher percentile of the race than last year, and when I compared times for the Run N Fun, TCTC, WRRT, and other former MIAC guys that ran in both 2012 and 2013 the only people who added less time than I did were Joe Moore and Finnel.  That stuff is nice, but before I saw the course I thought that I could be in the top 1/3 of the field and I didn't beat any of the people that I had my sights on.  Most of those guys got out hard and I never saw them during the race.  I don't think I really learned anything about my fitness from this.  Houston is 5 weeks away, so I'll just have to take confidence from workouts over the course of the next month."

Went to Lake Park Fitness to do this on the treadmill since I didn't think it would be doable outside after yesterday's snow.  Their website says that they offer guest passes so I didn't think that I would have any sort of problem.  Had the following exchange with an employee:

Her: Can I help you?
Me: Yes I was wondering if I could please get a guest pass to work out.
Her: Well this is a private health club.  You're supposed to be a member to work out here.
Me: I don't live in the area and your website says that you offer guest passes.
Her: Yes, we usually do but we usually don't to college students.
Me: I'm 25 and have been out of college for over 3 years, so do I qualify?
Her: Well, technically you're also supposed to be sponsored by a member and have them here with you.
Me: Well, my parents are members.  Can they sponsor me even though they're not here right now?
Her: I guess.

There were maybe 10 people in the facility at the time, making it even more ridiculous.  Oh well, paid the $15 (seemed like a bit much) and got to do my workout.  I wasn't real excited about doing this on the treadmill, but it wasn't that bad.  Having 2 football games on helped the time keep moving.  I felt really strong and comfortable.  Definitely could have kept going for a long time at this pace, which is funny since it's the same pace I ran in last weekend's race.  I'll probably do one more of these before Houston.

Last night of Metrodome running.  There were easily 100+ people there, but not too many in the fast lane so there weren't any problems doing the workout.  This went really well.  Every lap that I took a split on was sub 5:10 pace, and I felt strong and smooth.

PRed in the 8K and Half Marathon this year; unfortunately I wasn't able to use the fitness I had in the spring to get some other PRs because of the achilles injury.  I still wish I could have made it out to Hillsdale as I think I was in shape to run a really good 10K.  The second half of the racing year was a struggle thanks to low iron and a hamstring injury.  Thankfully those issues are cleared up now.

Results Goals for 2014:
1. PR in 3 of the 5K, 8K, 10K, and Half
2. No significant time off for medical issues
3. Marathon debut (it's time for this to happen)

Process Goals for 2014:
1. Continue to improve at the 'hard days hard, easy days easy' concept
2. Do the exercises I got in PT regularly, not just when something hurts
3. Sleep at least 7 (preferably 8) hours every night"

After watching the Badgers lose (New Years Day tradition, 4 years in a row) I suited up for run #2. Started by running to St Thomas and back. I wanted to do something faster at some point this week and came up with the idea to do this in my parking garage. It took about 35 seconds to do a lap, so probably right around 200 meters considering the 90 degree turns and that I was wearing trainers. Legs felt ok; a little flat since I haven't done many strides recently and did a 10 mile run this morning. Only saw one moving car while I was doing this...I'm sure they were very confused.

Drove down to St Olaf to do this since there wasn't anywhere in the Twin Cities that would work. Since I haven't done a workout like this in months and my legs didn't feel good yesterday I wasn't sure how this was going to go. During the drive and the warm up I got decently psyched up, and by the time I started I was in a good frame of mind. I felt strong. Running on a 200 meter track felt a little strange and I don't have a ton of explosiveness right now, but aerobically I'm in a good spot. These were about 15 seconds faster than goal half pace and should help 5:0X feel more relaxed. Finished with 2 x 150 at about 95% speed. Definitely couldn't have done this 2 weeks before Grandma's last June, so I'm excited about the prospects for Houston.

Other things
-For most of the workout the Gustavus basketball team was warming up on one of the courts inside the track. Their guys kept walking into lane 1, which was annoying. Olaf ended up crushing them 80-56.
-While I was cooling down Chris Daymont was riding around Tostrud on an elliptigo. She was also wearing a boot.
-Ate at Hogan Bros after. I'd argue that the sandwich was worth the drive by itself; the good workout just makes it better."

I was hoping to run a little bit faster, but this is ok. I thought I could be anywhere between 8:40 and 8:50 so I just ended up on the slower side. A time trial on a slow track off of half marathon training isn't realistically going to lead to a fast 3K. I let Dan go right away and ran in 2nd. Felt pretty good the first K, then during the second one I started slowing down a bit and was hitting more 35 highs and 36s than 35.0s. Went through the mile in 4:40, which is the first time I've run a sub 4:50 mile since Shamrock last April 7th. I don't really have any anaerobic capacity right now. A guy passed me with 800 left and we alternated laps from there to the finish before I put about 5 seconds on him in the last 200 (closed in 29 high or 30 low). In 2 months with more specific training I'll split this in a 5K. Warming up and cooling down with Dan and Tyler was fun. "

This was a nice comeback performance. Woke up at 3:30 to eat and get ready. The hospitality for most of the weekend was awesome but the one glitch was the race morning protocol. It took forever for the buses to get us from the hotel to the starting line (which was only about a half mile - should have just had us walk) and by the time we unloaded there were only 45 minutes until the gun. This meant that my warmup routine was a little rushed, but I relaxed and it worked out. They also had us warm up by jogging back and forth on about a three block stretch. Anyways, the race started and I made sure to really stay relaxed the first mile. It helped that the guys up front 'only' went out in 4:45 compared to last year's 4:20. When I went through in 5:05 I said, 'perfect' to myself. I was a couple steps off of a pack of guys at this point so during the second mile I bridged that gap in order to run with people. Ended up packing it up with Dworak and two other guys for most of the race. We hit really consistent splits and everyone took turns at the front...worked out well. For the first 2/3 of the race I felt great. I was not breathing hard, I felt smooth, and the pace did not feel fast. It felt kind of like a long tempo run. The course was pancake flat so it was pretty easy to stay in a rhythm, and there were a decent amount of people cheering which always helps. At 9 miles I thought I might have a shot at breaking 1:07, at 10 I figured it was unlikely since I would have to close in sub 15:45 and I was hurting, and at 11 I knew it wouldn't happen. Passed 10 miles about 4 1/2 minutes faster than what I ran at TC10 which is kind of funny. It's a lot easier to race when you're not anemic and injured. Somewhere around 11 one of the other guys and my feet got tangled up and I almost fell. He yelled that he would buy me a drink afterward and I told him not to worry about it. The last mile I could see Brandon and Dan Kerr not too far ahead up the road and I wanted to try to get them but my legs were dying. I glanced at my watch at the 1/2 mile to go sign and saw that I needed to run 2:30 in order to PR by a minute...ended up just barely getting it. When I passed my parents right before the last turn there were two guys just ahead of me. I went around them and tried to 'kick', but I moved a little bit too soon and they both got me back in the last 50 meters. When I crossed the line my stomach, back, shins, and quads were all hurting. 30+ minutes later I did a short cooldown with Dan and Sathre which did not feel good. Overall, definitely happy. 1:01 PR, finished 21 spots higher than I was seeded, and had a lot of fun during the weekend. The fact that I was on sub 1:07 pace for most of the race leaves me hungry for more, but I'm not sure when I'll do another half. The plan right now is to focus on shorter stuff for the next couple months and then make the 26.2 debut at Grandma's."

Long story short, the afternoon was chaotic and instead of leaving my office at 4 I left at around 8 after a 12 hour day. Got home and did not feel like running, but I eventually decided to do a short one to unwind a bit. Running on the treadmill did not sound fun so I layered up and went outside.

Cool-down: 

Kind of a frustrating evening. Warmed up and did strides, feeling fine, then started off on the Ks and couldn't hit the pace I was hoping for. I was planning to do 4 or 5 but after 3 I decided to switch to 600s so that I could run faster than 3:00/K pace. Scrapped the 150s I was planning to do at the end (see below). It wasn't like I felt horrible during any of this, but it was more difficult than I thought and I'm obviously not in the kind of 3K/5K shape that I would like to be in.

My left hamstring does not feel good. Unfortunately it feels very similar to how my right one felt last summer/fall, so I'm worried about it. I didn't feel it during strides before the workout, but during the cooldown it was definitely noticeable. I'm going to start addressing this right away and hopefully I can take care of it in a couple of days rather than having it affect me for 3 months. The combination of a disappointing workout and the hamstring flare up reaffirms that I need to just take things gradually and not force it. I was kind of hoping that I'd somehow be in shape to jump in a 5K at the end of indoors, but that's not realistic. Not a huge deal as I've got bigger fish to fry later on."

My goal was to run 3:45s and then hopefully finish with a 65.

Unfortunately there aren't markers for long intervals in lane 5, but Hamline pays to use the facility and I don't, so I obliged.  I think it worked out fine for the next 3 1200s...just ran for 3:45 and took the occasional 200 split.  I guess I'll have to do this again sometime in order to get splits on the whole thing.  On the last one I kind of slacked off in the middle...I think because I was worried about the 400 that I knew was coming.  I popped out to lane 6 in order to get an accurate split on this and ended up running 65.1.  It didn't feel extraordinarily difficult, but I definitely couldn't run a mile at that pace right now.  5:00 pace on the 1200s definitely felt like it would be doable for an 8K, so hopefully I can keep progressing and be in shape to run real fast in a month.

At the start a front pack of 5 formed pretty quickly.  I knew that I couldn't run with those guys so I slowed down, hoping to run with Lundstrom.  After about 30 seconds he started dropping back, so I had to choose between either really hitting the brakes to let the chase pack catch me or continuing on solo.  I chose to try to grind it out by myself, which was hard.  By two miles I was already feeling tired.  Max Renner blew past me near the turn around by the law school at 3 miles.  I had about two minutes with him before he dropped me and kept rolling.  My fourth mile was straight up slow.  It was into the wind, but running a 5:20 in an 8K is pretty bad.  At this point I knew I wouldn't break 25 which was kind of demoralizing.  I was able to bring it back down a little the last mile but couldn't make up any ground on Max.  Throughout the whole race I felt like I was running hard, but unfortunately afterward I didn't feel like I really used everything I had.  

We lost the team race to TCTC by 10 seconds.  Max was 10 seconds ahead of me, so if I would have beaten him we would have won.  That guy ran a great race.  Even with the conditions I still thought I could break 25 minutes today...perhaps I underestimated the effect of the cold/wind, or perhaps I'm not as fit as I thought I was.  I guess I'll have more of an idea after next weekend.  I kind of feel like I let the team down, but we'll have opportunities to even things up at other races."

This was a different sort of workout, but it was probably good for me to get this gear going.  It's been awhile.  I felt like my gas tank was running on empty, even on the warmup, which doesn't make sense seeing as I ate a big dinner last night and a decent amount throughout the day today.

It's been quite awhile since I've gotten in a good sub-tempo run, so I'm glad this one went well.  Legs felt a little strange on the warmup, probably because I hadn't run in basically 2.5 days.  I was worried about starting off too fast so I made sure to really start easy.  First mile was probably about 6:00, then I picked it up.  Coming off of Sunday's race and with a hard workout looming on Friday I was hoping to keep this moderate and that I could average 5:40-5:45.  I ended up coming in at 50:40, which is just under 5:40 pace, and the whole thing felt smooth and controlled.  Did six strides afterward.

Felt strong...I was definitely working but this felt easier than the Ks that I did 2 weeks ago which were at only a slightly faster pace.  The music that the Augsburg guys had going definitely helped.

Legs felt alright.  I was pretty hungry.

At the end of the run coming back over the Ford bridge I was passing a woman who lives in my building and is probably about 40.  She looked over at me and started speeding up.  I thought she'd drop back again after a short distance, but she stayed right next to me.

Birthday workout on the track at Mac.  Thankfully Matt Haugen didn't mind me working out at the same time as the Mac team.  After doing indoor workouts all winter the outdoor track looked huge on first glance.  There was some noticeable wind on the homestretch, but the temperature was great.  I wanted to get a hard effort in today and definitely accomplished that objective.  The 1:00 rest after the 800s was getting pretty short by the last two sets.  It was hard not to start too fast on the 800s coming off of the faster 400 and then the long rest.  Felt decent for the most part.  I had to dig a little on the last few reps, but I never doubted that I could finish the workout, so the amount of effort expended was about right.  2:20 is probably somewhere between 3K pace and 5K pace right now.

I started running from my apartment at 6:10 and went to Run N Fun to meet the group.  They were leaving just as the store was coming into view, so I timed it pretty well.  Kotek was leading the group...a couple blocks in he went straight and everybody else turned left (don't know if this was planned or not).  He didn't turn around.  We ended up doing Lilydale.  Talked about racing and D3 track with Kieser for most of the run.  Kieser ran back towards my apartment with me and then turned back at Randolph & Hamline.  When I passed the SPA track I got the idea to throw in a mile at around marathon pace.  I decided to go for it and ran a 5:23.  It actually felt pretty comfortable considering I was wearing a jacket, tights, and wet trainers and was 15+ miles into my run at this point.  I then took Randolph all the way down to the river and did a short add on to get 19.  Never ran out of energy.  Good run."

It was really windy...thought for a minute about pushing this back another day, but I can't do the workout and a 20 miler on back to back days and I don't want to have to do a long run on a weeknight right now when every day holds the potential for me being at work until 9 PM, so today was the day.  This was also my first time running with my GPS watch.  I started at the roundabout by Minnehaha Park and ran out three miles, came back for the next three, then did an out and back for the last two.

My plan was to run the first 7 miles of this at sub-tempo (5:40ish) and then close with a couple sub 5:30s.  I did two laps around my old morning 5 mile loop since I didn't want to have to stop at all.  The first lap was easy despite a decent amount of wind.  Every mile was in the 5:37-5:42 range.  Around mile 6 I first started to get the feeling that I might run out of gas before the end.  At 7 miles I sped up and ran a 5:26, then for the 9th mile I turned straight into the wind, and the wind combined with my lack of breakfast blew me up to the tune of around a 5:50 (much harder effort-wise than the 5:40s I was running earlier).  I thought briefly about ending the workout, but I decided that I needed the mental benefits that would come with grinding through another mile when I was low on energy so I finished the run and told myself to just get back under 5:45.  Shuffled through a laughably slow cooldown afterward.  I was still full from last night's dinner when I woke up this morning so all I ate was a granola bar, then I started the run 30 minutes later.  I need to be smarter than that.  All in all, not the run I was hoping for, but still a decently productive workout."

I saw a bunch of participants out running the course anyways.  Took a Gu at around 100 minutes and didn't have any problems with it.  Energy wise I felt great the entire time I was out there.

I might have gotten a little too excited...dropping a series of ~5:20 miles early in the marathon will not turn out well so hopefully I won't do that.  The last half of the second interval was up the three hills on East River.  Good practice for Lemon Drop.  On the last three miles I tried to just maintain even effort and not press to get to the end.  I felt pretty good when I finished.  Total time for 10 miles was 55:46, which is 2 seconds faster than I ran at TC10 last fall.  The hay's in the barn...now it's taper time."

06/21/2014,12:00 PM,Run,Race,28.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Pre Race

Had kind of a restless 'night' of sleep as I kept waking up and thinking my alarm was going to go off soon.  Finally got up at 4:15 and had a bagel with peanut butter, then got my stuff together and headed over to catch the shuttle.  Ate a Clif Bar on the bus (2 hours before race time).  It was not comforting to take a 45 minute bus ride to the starting line and realize that I now had to run all of that distance in order to get back to town.  When we got there I worked my way through the crowd to the elite tent.  It was about 50 degrees with light winds and a little bit of mist from time to time.  40 minutes out I went for a slow 10 minute jog, then did ballistics, and maybe 3 light strides.  Got to the corral between 7:35 and 7:40.  For some reason they started us 5 minutes late, but finally we were off.

Race

Until the day before the race I had not been planning on wearing my GPS watch, but on Friday I decided that I would wear it so that a) I could monitor my pace early and make sure I didn't get out way too hard, and b) I'd be able to have all of my splits at the end.  It was a good thing that I wore it because most of the elites were out super hard and I would have gotten sucked into that as well.  Went through the mile in 5:21, running by myself with a ton of people (including several women) ahead of me.  I just settled into a rhythm and tried to stay relaxed and roll.  By 2 miles people were already coming back, and even at 4 miles I started seeing people walking on the side of the road.  I was passing people at pretty regular intervals, and except for some guy that I caught up to that then played cat and mouse with me for a couple miles I didn't get passed by anyone until mile 22.  For most of the first half I felt like I was floating.  I was expecting to see basically no fans out there, but I thought that there were a decent number of cheering sections (not quite like Twin Cities, but it wasn't too lonely).  I gave a wave to Lisa Skildum and Zeke at the 5 mile mark, then I saw Grant at mile 6 and told him, 'Only 20 miles to go.'  My 'best case scenario' goal before the race was to run 2:23, and I came through the half right on pace at 1:11:29, but since the second half of the course is tougher than the first I figured at this point that I wasn't going to hit that so I started focusing on 2:24-2:25.

Miles 17 and 18 I ran a 5:35 and a 5:37.  I knew that if I slowed down anymore that it would really hurt my time and I hung on for one more mile, but after mile 19 the wheels started to come off a bit.  At the 19 mile mark I came to a complete stop to grab my bottle and starting up again was tough.  It's tough to describe exactly how I was feeling during miles 20-24.  My cardio was fine, mentally I never got the light headed/bonking feeling, and I felt like I had plenty of energy, but it was just tough to move my legs very fast.  I think it was part physical weakness, part mental weakness (from not knowing what to expect at this point, having never done this before), and part the fact that this is the toughest part of the course.  By the time I got to the top of Lemon Drop I felt like I was dying and when I saw a 5:59 split I wasn't sure if I was even going to break 2:30.  Max caught me at around 23 and tried to get me rolling again.  I hung just off of him.  Once I got into downtown I saw a bunch of friends cheering (the two people I most vividly remember are Anders Bowman and Adrian), and I realized that I was actually going to finish and got a bit of a second wind.  With a mile to go I thought I might still be able to break 2:26, but I ended up being just over.  Coming down the finishing straight was a pretty exhilarating feeling, even if my legs were way too tired to sprint. 

Post Race

When I first crossed the line I still felt alright (probably from adrenaline), but by the time I got my bag a couple of minutes later my body was in a world of hurt.  My hips were the worst part and I could not walk normally.  Found Aleta, talked briefly with some other people, and then eventually made the walk to the shuttle.  The shuttle dropped us off on the opposite side of the mall from where I wanted to be and I proceeded to walk across the parking lot at about 2 miles per hour.  Once I got a shower, drank a bunch of water, and ate some solid food I came around quite a bit.  We stopped twice on the drive back to the cities so that I could move a bit and stretch, but by the evening I felt significantly better than I had immediately after finishing.

Thoughts

Overall I am happy with my performance.  My time goal was 2:23-2:25, and I wasn't that far off.  My main objective in doing this was to get the experience of running a marathon so that I can be better prepared for it in the future, and I feel like I learned quite a bit.  I now know what it feels like to get 18-20 miles in and still have a good amount of running left before you're done.  Training wise I came into this off of a fairly short marathon specific cycle.  That was ok for this one, but for my next marathon I will do 10-12 weeks instead of 8.  I liked the course, although I don't think it's as fast as some people claim.  There are plenty of rolling hills out there.  I took Gu at miles 9 and 19.  Didn't have any problems with it and I'm sure it helped me.  Maybe next time I should do a third?  I need to practice more with fluids before my next one, as most of the times I took water I either spilled most of it or was only able to get a sip or two.  Fortunately it was only 50 degrees so drinking a ton of fluids wasn't essential.  Overall I had fun out there and it was awesome to see so many Oles, both racing and cheering.  Also great to get a ton of positive comments afterward."

Couple of hills but not constantly rolling.  We ran by a bunch of really nice houses.  Beautiful weather with the temperature in the upper 60s.  We started off relaxed, but by halfway we were cruising.  The second hour was pretty steady around 6:00 pace and then we threw in a couple 5:45-5:50s towards the end.  I was only planning on going about 17, but since I felt good I decided to just go the whole way with Kieser, Easker, and Grant.

I did a longer warmup (30 minutes) and then just rolled into the fartlek without any stopping.  Started off at around half marathon effort and moved closer to 8K/10K effort towards the end.  It was pretty easy, but a good way to get some quality in.  Finished with six strides.

It also seemed like I was always running into the wind, no matter which direction I tried.  Instead of running a hard 300 at the end I decided to just run the last 200 fast.  I ended up banging out a 27.95 and felt like I even had one more gear available.  I probably won't do this workout again this summer but I'm going to keep mixing in some stuff that gets the fast twitch fibers going.

I was planning on at least signing up for the 2015 race even though it's only six weeks after CIM since it was such a fun trip last year and I think I could run reasonably well on residual fitness and a couple of post-break tuneup workouts (six weeks from Grandma's would have been last weekend and I could have run a half just fine in decent weather).  I hope to be fit enough to break 1:07 at Des Moines this fall, but it doesn't look like that even gets free lodging anymore and I'm not going to spend ~$1000 to run a race unless I'm going to be ready to run really well in it.

I would have liked to shoot for 9:50 but it was windy and my legs were still feeling pretty dead so I adjusted my goal to 10:00 since I didn't want to strain.  I basically ran even 75s.  The 400s were pretty easy at this pace but trying to go faster would not have been.  Hopefully this weekend I can catch up on sleep and make sure I avoid falling into a hole.

I did this workout (with 8 400s) in 2012 and hit essentially the same times.  At that time I had been doing workouts on the track for several weeks so I was sharper, and I remember thinking that it was a really good workout.  8 days later I ran 31:23 in terrible weather at Get In Gear.

First long sub-tempo run of this marathon cycle.  I did 2 laps of my old 5 mile morning route in Appleton (just like I did in May).  The wind was tough in spots.  It took a few minutes to find the right pace, as I started off with a 3:00 half mile, but once I got going mid 5:40s felt pretty smooth.  Didn't really try to pick it up at the end but I must have subconsciously sensed that I was almost done.  I didn't feel beat up when I finished, and I'm guessing that I could have maintained this pace for quite awhile, so I'm happy with where I'm at.

Went to the Packers home opener in the afternoon.  We got off to a rough start and went down 21-3, then stormed back for a 31-24 win.  The Jets' tying touchdown was negated thanks to someone calling timeout before the play started.  Jordy Nelson 200 receiving yards.

I definitely was running sub 5:00 pace.  Took the hills one at a time.  Tonight's ride on the pain train will help me at Griak if I decide to race there.  

Met one of my new neighbors in the elevator when I got back.  Not a very friendly lady.

Edit: I mapped out the 6:00 interval (it was an out and back) and I was about 4:45 pace on that.  Then on the last interval I started from the same spot but made it further, so that was a low 2:50s 1K.  Looks like I ran a little too fast, as 4:45 pace is certainly not 8K pace."

Mason was doing 16 x 1K, so Kieser and I sat out the first two and then jumped in.  It took me about five repeats to fully get Kieser's loop down...not a good day for my sense of direction.

Mason was right next to me the whole way until my last one, then he finished up with a 3:08 and a 3:01 by himself.  I felt strong.

Dennis Kimetto ran about a minute per mile faster than this to set the marathon world record in Berlin this morning.  That's definitely humbling.

It was warm this morning.  I got out the door around 9:30 and in hindsight I wish I had gotten up an hour earlier.  I was also a little worried that sprinting around at Griak and the amount of time I spent on my feet yesterday might affect the workout, but it still went well.  Stayed on West River since there was an all women's race taking place on East River and it would have been awkward running next to that.  I got into a nice rhythm for most of it.  I lost some time on the uphills, so that'll be a focus as I keep getting more into marathon specific stuff.  In the last mile I passed a biker who then didn't like the fact that I passed her and tried to race me for a minute.  Since it was my last mile I was down to play along a little bit.  She then turned off.  30+ seconds faster than 2 weeks ago, on a tougher course and with warmer weather.  Good progress.  It's been a good 3 week stretch.  Now I'm going to take a bit of a down week.

I've stayed up until after midnight just about every night this past week, I didn't get my full normal pre race/long workout breakfast, and I got out too fast at the start.  That said, I battled through and got the 10 miles of work in.  Three miles in I felt like I was going to blow up, then I settled down.  It was pretty windy; I think the last workout I did where the wind wasn't a factor was the Ks with Mason over a month ago.  I wasn't feeling up to fighting the wind for a 5th mile repeat at the end so I decided to just finish with a slightly faster 1K.  Next weekend's workout will be strictly marathon pace.

Started the sub-tempo shortly before the Lake St Bridge, then crossed at Franklin, hit the hills on East River, and finished pretty close to my building.

Had to put a little more into it to stay on pace through the hills on East River, but I stayed right on it.  At 8 miles I took a Gu.  Got it down fine but then it took me about a half mile to catch my breath.  I'm not sure what happened on mile 11.  Must've been a particularly windy mile.  Running the last 2 miles I felt like I still had a fair amount of energy left, but after I stopped my legs quickly tightened up and the cooldown was not comfortable.

The first interval was a little bit of a shock for the legs without having done any drills or strides, but after that things were good.  3 nights in a row of 8-9 hours of sleep has helped me a lot.

12/07/2014,12:00 PM,Run,Race,28.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"The bus left from downtown Sacramento at 5 AM.  I sat next to Mike, a guy originally from London who now lives in San Francisco and trains with Malcolm.  Small world.  We got out to the start and hung out in the tent until it was time to warm up.  I felt pretty good, although the three Gus that I had pinned to my shorts were weighing them down a bit so I ripped one off.  When the gun went off the 2:18 pace rabbits started off faster than planned and I think most of the elite/sub-elite men were keying off of them, so everyone got out hard.  I went through the mile in 5:14 and the main pack was probably 10 seconds up (with the Africans another ~10 seconds ahead of them).  I slowed it down for mile 2, then mile 3 was the only part of the race where I ran with someone for more than about a minute.  We ran a 5:10, which was too fast so I dropped back.  I found my rhythm pretty soon after that, but I was still running a little faster than I had planned on.  In my first marathon I felt effortless for the first 10 miles and this time I didn�t, so I was a little worried, but I decided that if I had started too fast the damage was already done so I might as well just roll with it.  I felt like the course map was a bit deceptive.  The first half of the race was pretty much constantly rolling, and several of the uphills were reasonably long.  Fortunately this was the part of the race where my legs were still fresh and the uphills were balanced out by nice gradual downhills, but through the first half I was thinking, �This is seriously where everyone comes to run fast?!�  That said, the second half of the course definitely is fast.

My official goal coming in was sub 2:22, but I really thought that I was capable of breaking 2:21 so I was targeting a low 1:10 split at the half.  Ended up going through in 1:09:32.  I ran the next 4 miles in 21:02 and when I still felt strong at 17 I realized that unless I totally died I was going to break 2:22 and that I had a real shot at breaking 2:20.  Even at 20 miles I was still on 2:19 low pace.  It started getting pretty tough after that, but I tried to just take it one mile at a time and I didn�t crash anywhere near as badly as at Grandma�s.  I had taken my first Gu at mile 10, then I kept putting off when I was going to take the second one and almost decided that I wasn�t going to, but I did it just before 21.  Despite the fact that I was slowing down I was passing people regularly.  I was 43rd at the half, 29th at 20, and 21st at the finish.  By about mile 24 my quads were pretty much shot.  It felt like I was dying but I was close enough to the end where I knew I�d make it.  I passed two guys somewhere between 25.5 and 26 and ended up putting 35 seconds on them, so they were pretty much crawling.  At the 26 mile mark there was a guy dressed like Jesus holding a sign that said �THE END (of the race) IS NEAR!�  I didn�t really have a �kick�, but I tried to run as strong as possible the last 0.2.

I definitely put out a max effort.  I was able to walk alright after I crossed the line, but my quads hurt badly and my stomach was absolutely destroyed.  I tried to eat some lunch, but my body couldn�t digest it and for the next several hours pretty much all I could do was lay around and watch football.  I�ve never felt so bad for such an extended period of time after a race.  Eventually I rallied a bit and was able to enjoy some pizza and beer in the evening.

Obviously I�m thrilled with how this went.  I thought that I was capable of a time like this on my best day, but I almost never hit those �best day� goals so I told myself I�d be happy with anything under 2:22.  Running 2:20:16 now makes sub 2:18 seem like something that I can actually think about rather than just dream about.  My training cycle (13 weeks) went just about perfectly.  If I could do it again there are only a couple of small things that I would change.  The longer workouts that I did definitely helped me, and I�ll follow a similar blueprint for the next one.  The number of texts and Facebook messages that I got afterward was almost overwhelming.  I had no idea that so many people were interested in my race, and I appreciate the support a lot.  Now I�m going to enjoy some downtime and then figure out how I want to approach 2015."

The year doesn't end until tomorrow but I'm going to jump the gun a bit with the 'year in review'.

Positives From 2014
1. I started the year with a half marathon PR that was big for my confidence after how poorly the second half of 2013 went.
2. I stayed healthy, aside from an off and on hamstring problem that for the most part I could run through.  Didn't have any extended breaks in training.
3. I made significant strength gains from consistently doing longer long runs and tempos.
4. In this sport one great race at the right time can make a season (or a year) a success, and my run at CIM certainly qualifies.  To put so much energy and focus into one event and have it turn out as well as it did was immensely satisfying.

Negative(s)
1. Aside from Houston and CIM the rest of my racing this year was kind of lackluster.  During the spring I was consistently about 5 seconds per mile off of where I wanted to be.  I attribute this to not following a proper workout progression in February and March after Houston.  Food poisoning wiped out Victory and I think was also still affecting me at Alumni.  The TC 10K and Des Moines were good runs - nothing to jump up and down about, but everything was geared towards CIM at that point.  All that said, if you write Victory off due to the GI issues the only race this year that I really bombed was the LAX 10K.  From 2010 - 2013 I probably had 5+ terrible races each year, so I can live with one bad day.

What's Next
The first part of the year will be geared towards shorter races.  I'll probably run 2 races indoors, then hopefully something around the beginning of March depending on what I can find, and then Shamrock on 3/29.  I would like another shot at a track 10K but I doubt that it will happen this spring since unfortunately there aren't any real good ones that don't require a multiple day trip.  The big goal for the year is to run sub 2:18.  I haven't fully decided when my next marathon will be but right now I'm leaning towards Grandma's.  If I decide to wait until the fall or if I don't hit the standard there I'll run Chicago in October.

No morning run - stayed up late last night and wanted to get 7 hours of sleep instead of 4-5 extra miles. On my warmup through the U of M campus some kids (probably freshmen) complimented me on my tights and told me to 'take my fucking hat off.' The workout went fairly well. It was better than any VO2 workout that I did last year.

Not much of a gear shift for the last 200. I recovered reasonably quickly afterward; in a way it felt more like a really hard interval than an all our race.

I didn't want to leave work early today to go to the indoor track so I attempted a treadmill workout.  The plan was 6 x 5 minutes at 5:12 pace with 2 minutes steady in between.  On the third rep my knee started bugging me, then I stopped the workout 2 minutes into #4 because I was really altering my stride.  I don't think it will take long to get this under control, but racing this weekend is probably out.  Not worth taking any risks for this one.  Knee aside I was feeling strong.  Running fast on the treadmill doesn't seem to agree with me.  This whole issue started back in January after a treadmill workout, and before tonight I hadn't had any problems for awhile.  Stuff like this further solidifies the fact that if I qualify for the trials I will go someplace warmer for 6-8 weeks before the race in order to do all of my training outside."

After the St Thomas hill we dialed it back a notch since I didn't want to get any faster.  I know I've wrote about the weather the past several days, but this early spring (especially now combined with daylight savings time)  is seriously exhilarating after running in the dark and cold all winter.

After 3 days of minimal running and poor lifestyle choices in general I wasn't sure how I'd feel today.  I didn't exactly feel like a finely tuned machine, but this run still went well.  Averaged sub 5:40 for 50 minutes, which I did not expect.  It was about 30 degrees.  Colder than I'd like, but not bad.  Hustled afterwards to get over to watch the Irish Run.

Thus I scrapped the Friday fartlek and instead made today's workout kind of a Joe Moore workout by tacking on a few Ks at the end.  Also, Prez and Kelly got engaged last night so I was out pretty late celebrating that, which led to a later start than planned this morning.  That might have workout out for the better since it was warmer.  

The sub-tempo was really smooth.  My goal pace was 5:40s and I was ahead of that the entire time.  I felt strong and relaxed.  Had to increase the effort a little the last two miles when I was going into the wind, but it still didn't feel like I was really grinding.  I did both Ks with the wind.

The second one mostly had a crosswind.  On the one half mile segment where I had the wind at my back I ran a 2:34 and it felt like I was recovering.  I had a tailwind for the hills and ran them fast.  I didn't feel all that beat at the end (which is good since I need to be able to run 26.2 miles at this effort in 61 days).  This was a great turnaround from Saturday's debacle.  The rest of the week will be easy leading up to Get In Gear.  Looking forward to getting after it.

I wanted to do something that would raise my muscle tension before Saturday but not make me tired.  70 second 400s didn't feel quite as effortless as I would like, but it's not like they were hard.  On the other hand the 200 felt really easy.  I guess we'll see what we get in 36 hours.  Got some Panera afterward, then went to watch the 5Ks at Macalester.  It was a perfect night for a race."

04/25/2015,12:00 PM,Run,Race,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"This was really disappointing.  I came in expecting a sub 31 and hoping to take a shot at my fastest 10K ever (30:44), and I wasn't even close.  I got out with the first pack (7 guys, with Sathre and a Kenyan out front) as I planned.  What wasn't planned was that I spent most of the first 2 miles leading this group, but I was feeling really good and we weren't running all that fast.  Just after the Lake St bridge someone (I think it was Austin Bauer) made a move.  I let one negative thought enter my mind and started to lose the group, then I pretty much crawled up the St Thomas hill and that totally knocked me out of contention.  I tried a few times to battle back on East River but it wasn't happening.  By 5 miles I felt terrible and just wanted to stop.  Kieser got me on the Ford bridge and went by hard enough that I couldn't latch on.  The Kenyan guy had fallen off and was jogging so I passed him to get back into 9th.  After the race I had a terrible attitude and just threw my stuff in my backpack and walked home without cooling down or talking to anyone.  I'm kind of embarrassed about my lack of sportsmanship.  

This result leaves me confused.  I felt so good for almost 3 miles, then within about 10 seconds I suddenly felt horrible.  Perhaps running at the front of that group was dumb, but leading at 5 minute pace in a 10K when it's not super windy shouldn't be that big of a deal.  It could be that the inconsistency in my training the past few months is catching up with me, or maybe it was simply a mental failure, although I thought that I was done with those.  Either way, I've got to shake this off and move on.  I keep telling myself that I'll be ok, but the way things have been going it's hard to see 2:17 happening in 8 weeks.  I guess we'll see where I am after a month of ~100 mile weeks and marathon specific workouts."

It was nice to have a good run and remind myself that I like running since yesterday I wasn't so sure about that.  I almost continued on for another 10 miles since I was feeling good, but I decided to stick with my plan and wait until tomorrow.  As I was coming back into my building a family stopped me and asked me a bunch of questions about my running since apparently they see me coming back from runs a lot.  It was kind of an awkward conversation, but I guess it's nice when people are interested."

It's not a great feeling to be driving home from work with a 21 mile run hanging over your head.  I ran down West River, crossed the Franklin Bridge, went through the U of M, across the Stone Arch Bridge, down to the end of the path, added on a little loop, came almost all the way back on the east side of the river, then crossed the Lake St Bridge and ran the rest of the way home via West River.  Legs felt ok throughout.  By the end they were pretty tired (my left one more than my right one, which was weird).  I got side aches a couple of different times that prevented me from really opening up, but my average pace was still around 6:20, which is fine.

My legs were tired and didn't have much pop, but this was still pretty easy.

It was probably for the better to just keep this a moderate effort anyways.  Decent wind on the backstretch.  Now hopefully I can recover for a tough run on Saturday."

This was fine - after feeling bad most of the week I didn't feel like I needed to set a workout PR today.  I felt pretty good most of the way.  The St Thomas hill at 9 miles put a dent in my legs but we maintained pace.  It's also nice that I can hold a conversation at this pace.

I feel really good about this one.  When I ran a similar workout 6 weeks out from CIM I averaged 5:22 on the first section and 5:11 on the miles.  Outside of mile 3 (which included both a hill and a 180 degree turn around) I felt strong.  There was a bike event taking place on West River Road and I bet that there were hundreds of people out there.  Never felt like I was straining on the miles, and with a gun to my head I could have done a few more.  I'm starting to get to where I need to be - now I need to keep building off of this.

The goal on the tempo was to run ~5:30s for the first six and then ~5:20s for the last two.  I never really found the 5:30 pace and was consistently between 5:32 and 5:35.  Ran 5:20, 5:17 for the last two.  Aerobically this was a cakewalk.  My legs didn't feel terrible, but I was noticeably tired.  I also had no caffeine today, which could have been a contributing factor.  Hopefully I'll feel quite a bit better in a week and a half when I hope to go twice as far at roughly this same pace.

I didn't quite get down to my goal marathon pace (5:15s), but I wasn't that far off and for a day where I didn't feel great I will take it.  On the third one (my first one by myself) I dropped a 2:45 800 but told myself to get back on it and was fortunately able to do so.
