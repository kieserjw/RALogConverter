Reflecting on yesterdays workout and the future:
Naturally when one has accumulated something, and in this case decent running shape, one enviably will become more ambitious and also worried about losing 'it' i.e. an injury. 
So I must be sure not to get to worked up, and remember that I have 4 months more of training on top of which many nights of midnight study sessions will occur. Thus, I have to accept the inevitability of bad workouts, races ect. AND also accept that I want to run best at the end of the season, which, as a side note, will be a time when classes are done.

On championship road. Did 7 miles threshold with a progressively faster pace. Got a side stitch (Tombo did also- perhaps from P 90 X AB WORK OUT BLAST) we both did yesterday. The seven miles were (according to a conservative estimate) at 5:20 pace, although my watch had me at 7.09 in 36:56. The watch was acting up the first mile and said we ran a 5:07 when I know it was much slower. Solid tempo, didn�t actually run too hard which is fine with the higher mileage switch.

I love running, competing and being on a team, but if I can't (the body) handle a pace there is only so much I can do-- The CC team is too strong this year to have a 7th guy running 26:00 at nattys.
 Its too bad this season ended like this, and it certainly isn't ideal for going in to (what I hope to be) the best track season I will ever have. But I think I can handle it. There has been to many times in the last few years where it seemed that I have experienced the depths of my soul: for example at natty's outdoor 5k-- and I found that no matter how much I'm hurting or how nervous I get I still got something in me that says 'keep pushing', its cliche and lame, but I an't a defeatist, and I an't a headcase.

This was a mixed result. First the bad: I ran 409. The good: I lead the whole thing, and that's not an easy task. It was an odd last week and a half. Running those workouts last week and having Barker tell me I'm doing better workouts than sub 4 milers have done changed my mental frame- I sort of expected to run 400-403 today. I think the worst thing that's happened the last couple months to me is that I'm really starting to believe that no matter what I do I just won't reach goals I set for myself. The obvious response is to 'keep trying' however, you're living in lala land if you keep trying for something that over and over again you never get. Eventually one has to give up or lower their standards. Running 409 with a goal of 359 feels like I'm a monkey trying to invent a rocket ship, like ELB breaking 2 minutes in the 800. Hopefully I'll be going to Iowa state for the 3k in two weeks. Another opportunity. "

Combo of the 239 and a minute break made the last k really tough, got rolled on the last one but bounced back for the 400s. Probably should have let Jon grey roll the 239 solo and chill.
