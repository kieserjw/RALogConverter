I'll probably run down to ohio drive one of the next few days to try to figure out where I turned around, but right now I'm thinking I ran the faster times.

Wasn't completely warmed up at first so I started slow.  Distances (paces) were 3.6 (5:34), 2.77 (5:26), 1.88 (5:20), 1 (5:10).  I decided to finish the mile on the last interval.  


This workout was a little slower than the last time I did it, but this time I was coming into it with a lot more mileage.  I would also say my effort level was much lower.  I didn't kill any one of those intervals.  My biggest challenge right now is that the area between too fast and too easy is really small right now.  I feel like I can go for forever at 5:40 right now, but at 5:25 I'm working really hard.

I think that was a good decision.  Goal for today was to win the race in a solid time, but not damage my legs to the point that I couldn't do 23 miles today.  I think I accomplished both goals.  John and I sat on two guys for the first mile then i decided the pace was slow (high 5:30s) so I took the lead.  I could still hold a full conversation at 3 miles when John and I surged to drop 3rd place.  Coming over the dam I dropped John and was on my own from the turnaround on.  I dropped the pace a bit when I turned around (out in 20:35, back in 20:10) but at no point was the race that hard.  I didn't kick to much just tried to focus on turnover at the end and dropped the pace to around 5:05 for the last 400m.  I'm calling this a tempo because I think I had another 5-10 seconds a mile in the bank if I had been pushed.  Next weekend I'll test myself a bit more."

really great tempo.  Heavy wind the whole way out.  Went out for 26 minutes then back in a little under 24.  On the way out my HR was under 160, gradually increased the effort until I hit the mid 160s for the last mile.  John stayed with me the whole time which was nice.  I probably would have slowed down the last couple miles if he hadn't hung with me.
5:49, 5:46, 5:51, 5:54, .8 mile turnaround section, 5:25, 5:21, 5:27, 5:14

This workout was the same average pace at the 40 minute tempo I did 6 weeks ago.  I think the temperature was about the same, but the wind was worse today.  Also, I was wearing heavier shoes today and running on the towpath.  I'd say I could hit 5:30 for this under ideal conditions with a tempo effort.  

Encouraged by the faster pace for the last mile.  I need to be more comfortable at quicker paces.  I'll probably try to throw in a few quicker miles on the workout this weekend."

Jumped on the trails heading south from the entrance just north of 32nd st.  Remembered why I run this trail in the other direction when I wiped out by the drain pipe.  I also need to find a better way to connect this trail to the north.  I ended up running up a dry creak to get back on the normal trails which didn't make for a good run.  Glad I was in tights today because the fall skinned up my hands and hip a bit.  They really hurt for a few minutes, but I didn't do any permanent damage.  Right calf still really tight.

Built up speed on each one and ran the last one pretty fast.  Legs felt pretty good.  I'm still surprised by the paces I'm getting.  It seems like we are running faster than what I get when I map things.  It might just be the night running that makes things feel fast, but I thought we'd be closer to 7 min pace. Calf felt fine.  I stretched it a lot today and I guess that helped."

We started to slow on the second so I threw in a surge to get us back on pace.  Definitely could have done another mile at least without the workout being very hard.  Its now 2 hours later and I don't even feel like I ran a workout.  Good sign for things to come.  Afterwards did 5 strides on the soccer field.  Was moving pretty well on each of those as well."

I kind of messed up the route I wanted to run, but I think in the confusion we ran an extra mile or so which means I have no complaints.  

Feeling pretty good after 2 days with lower mileage.  Going to need a legitimate long run this weekend to make up for light running to start out the week."

Same hill as last week, but 2 more reps. Last week was 1:35 then a little 1:30 for the rest. This week  started with 2 around 1:34-5 then consistently cut down from 1:29 to 1:27 over the last 5.

An average of 2 seconds faster on each one than last week. Have the splits uploaded to garmin. Felt better than last week and showed some speed dropping a 29 on the first lap of the last one in route to a 60. Hope we do this one more week so I can drop some faster time"

Workout with TRC. Took it out hard on the first one which which made the rest of the workout quite difficult. I think it was good to get a little gut check. Haven't done anything this fast is a long time. The 800s were the hardest by far. I don't see to have the endurance speed you need for those."

Cool-down: 

With Peter, Dan, and Grant in lane 6 of the indoor track. Workout was alternating hard 200 with a 200 jog. Was hitting the 200s in 32 in trainers. Moved on the last two and broke 30. Felt more aerobic than I would have thought. There were a few times I was really gasping for air on recovery. Pretty happy with the workout. I think these would have been a full second faster if I had worn flats."

04/13/2014,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,13.30,miles,6000,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Well that was a long one. Wanted to get a longer run with Jake. Longer for me right now is basically anything over 5 miles so this fit the bill. We went west on lake then came back along the minnehaha trail to lake hiawatha. That run is always longer than I think it will be. I really like the route so I keep doing it, but I haven't managed to get myself in shape to do it comfortably. Achilles hurt a little bit two separate times for a minute or two. nothing that affected my stride and I got ice on it 4 times afterwards. I think I'm just going to start running through this a bit and hope it gets better.

"
04/14/2014,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.50,miles,2460,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Solo run to the river south along the high trails then across at Minnehaha Academy then wound back. Achilles wasn't bad. I iced twice afterwards. Last night's meeting has me motivated to get better from this injury and get back in shape. It has me thinking about goals for this season
1. Sub 16 minute 5k on Memorial Day (Oh how fall I've fallen)
2. Be able to touch my toes when I wake up in the morning
3. Abs 3 days a week
4. 30 Pull ups 
5. 40 Push ups

Obviously I'm focusing on getting some strength and flexibility for the next couple months. I want to get a solid base by the end of June so I can try to crush the fall. The goal for this Spring is to stay healthy and get some mileage under my belt."

After that settled into a pace around 7 mins the rest of the way. I wish I could say 9 miles at 7 min pace is easy for me right now, but it definitely wasn't. I felt like I was pushing for the second half a little. My HR was probably around 150. I should start wearing my monitor again so I have a better idea. Stretched quite a bit after and got in an ice after we went out to dinner. Achilles was pretty much the same as yesterday."

04/22/2014,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,7.50,miles,3300,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Biked to school today then from school to RnF. That meant I had 11 miles in running before the run and I was definitely feeling it. Turned off early with Kelly for 7ish then we did 8 striders in the street. the good news is that I had no achilles pain today. My left IT band is feeling a little tight in the knee, but I'm basically sore all over right now from the lifting and everything so I'm not that concerned. Hoping that next week I'll be in good enough shape to hang with the top group."

They were doing the Fulton Gran Fondo which is a 100 mile ride and biking 15 miles to get there. So we biked to the start of the ride in a pack around 18mph average. Then waited around for a half hour for the ride to start and took off with 1200 other people on a ride. It was pretty crazy to be biking in a group that bike. I just stayed to the outside and tried not to hit anyone. There were only a few times where I had to come to a stop but then we got on the greenway and could open up a bit. 

It was tough to decide when to turn around because I was in a pack so it was pretty easy to keep up, but I knew the way back would be more tiring. Ended up turning around a little earlier than I needed to because I was still able to PR on the Sabo Bridge Climb a mile from home."

Afternoon run from Andrea's. I was sore starting out from yesterday. I actually stopped for a few minutes about 1.5 in to let my body get back on track. 

It was a weird run. Lots of struggling at the beginning but then a fairly fast middle (mid 6's) finished at a slower pace but it was pretty uphill. The heat (mid 80s) is killing me. "
