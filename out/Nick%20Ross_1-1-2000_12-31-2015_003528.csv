mile hard, 3 mile tempo run, mile all out. only recovery is running back to the line.

opened hard, 5:15, which in the arb, on the old course, in trainers isn't half bad. me and kennedy 'tied' if you will, for first. not that we were racing.

as soon as we finished we went into the tempo.

5:32
5:34
5:31

fished that (and it was miserable - forgot how heavy trainers feel after a few miles). finished behind hartman, caught and ran away from kennedy in the last half mile, anders fell back a second or two in the last half also.

from there we jumped right on the track and i ran 5:04.

the 5:04 didn't feel all that hard. the last 300 i was definitely going all out, but i didn't want to die so the first 3 laps were paced. fast, but controlled. hate 'could have's' and 'should have's' but IF id have known i wouldn't die, i could have went sub 5 for the last one. i was holding back in places.

i'm a huge pussy. that aside, john leaf came down to pace/run with me. the plan was 5 flat, sub 10:10, and then just try to kill the last mile. well it was tough cuz all the 17:00 champs had to take off hard, and neither leaf nor myself got to touch the rail till a mile and a half. so after last weeks mishap, i figured i'd stay relaxed as long as i could, then race when it came time. i could have been mildly conversational through 2 miles. very relaxed, which i suppose led to my demise. a lack of toughness definitely came into play, and i just wanted the race to come to me, which of course they never do. anyhow, mile 3 my legs actually were the limiting factor rather than cardio, so that was new. the achilles was screaming at me, and is all swollen so there'll be no run tomorrow. just ice and heat. looks like conference may be out of the picture this year. awesome."

didnt know the workout till after the warmup, then brenden took our watches, and had the girls in order from slowest to fastest (generally) start one at a time every 10 seconds. then the same with boys with maybe a minute between the girls and us. my goal was to catch everyone by bus farm road (just over 2 miles into it) i was 3:10 or 3:20 behind the leader. like clockwork i took the lead the the corner of busfarm road. seemed to back off pace a little on top of the hill, it was windy and i had no more people to catch. on fort road i heard kuhn closing behind me and i took off. the last 800 or so i was going all out. held him off physically, but he beat me by 1 second after figuing in the stagger. hartman also beat me by a bit. gosh running fast in trainers is really hard. those things are heavy. also, we didnt know how long this would be. brenden said he'd be pulled over on the side of the road somewhere.

obviously like to double tonight and get at least 15 in for the day, but coming in to today not knowing if id run or not, i' not gonna do anything stupid"

I started off modest, 6:45 min/mile or so for the first 3, just testing out the calf which has had ice on it more than it hasn't for the last 24 hours. it felt like... like someone took a solid swing with a bat into the back of my lower leg, and then told me to go running. it may very well be bruised from all the rolling/grastoning. but bruising is better than adhesion, so bring it. anyway, i found myself out on the run today starting to pick up the pace, not pressing, but just floating - i'd catch it and slow back down to around 7 minute miles. between miles 5 and 6 i thought wtf, a lot of my friends/teammates are running the lumberjack 10 miler today, and if i didnt have to work id be racing it, so around mile 6 i decided i'll just let it go and roll with it. I kept it slower than tempo run pace (effort), just worked on running fast, relaxed. the only split i got was my last mile, 5:42, rolling through 10 miles in 1:02:06 (6:12.5 pace) then i tacked on 2 more slow ones just to cool down a bit. not a bad time considering i really only went for it for the 2nd half.

We've known each other for some time now, and we've been through a lot. You're good at most things, i mean - the girls you bring in have never been dogs, and for that i'm thankful. I know sometimes i dont feed you the best things, but you enjoy it for a little while right? i mean, those chinese buffets are good going down arent they? Lately though, you've been making running less than pleasurable for me. is there any way we can resolve this? I know i ask a lot of you, so i'll be patient, but if you could take care of things by the end of the week it would be great, because, well...

WARNING: if you get offended easily, or at all, ever, just stop reading now.

knowing that giving a disclaimer does nothing but pique interest, and no one has stopped yet; read on.

somewhere out in my delirium i came up with a new word, and feel it should be shared with the world.

the word describes what female porn stars do when they go do work.
That word is: schlonk.

they don't have sex, the don't even fuck. they schlonk. It's like a combination of bonk and schlong, both fitting subjects. I feel it is prefectly tasteless and classless, sounds passive enough to be completely void of emotion, and with just the right degree of vulgarity. to me it sounds like how you would describe a really loose chick getting slapped in the cooter with a big rubber dong and it just slippin' right on in. 

'Wow martha, i cant believe how hard he schlonked me today!'

The masculine form of the word, now hold on to your seats, is flonk.

same concept.

'yeah Tim, I'd stay away from sally, there's no tread left. she bent over and i just flonked it right in.

Remember folks, you heard it here first. mainstream by labor day."

I was gonna call it after 15 but bartley has never gone 18 and wanted to do it, so wtf. Anyway, the plan was to go down after work, get there around 1030, make poor lifestyle choices, then run with kuhn, delaubs, kurt, marbar, and brooke. well let's just say some of the guys had nights that ended up better than mine did (insert coy, sexual tone) and i ended up running with just marbar and brooke.

I didnt sleep that long, was super dehydrated, it was hot, humid, and in retrospect, i didnt eat enough food yesterday. bonked hardcore today, but i'm not concerned, as there were so many factors at play. i have nothing to do now, so im gonna sleep all afternoon, but brooke has to work a 9 hour shift, on her feet the whole time. how terrible right? i started this run weighing 151, and after running it, eating a 32 ounce jamocha shake, an erbs and gerbs sub, a 32 ounce gatorade, 2 glasses of water, another glass of gatorade, and 16 ounces of diet coke, i weigh 148.8. i wonder how much i lost during that run. someday i'll do the math.

second, before i get 9000 comments about how i need to settle down so i dont burn out, know that this wasnt intentional.

that having been said, i cant believe i'm at 130.5 in 7 days, and over 105 are in singles. seems unreal. now i know how dan greeno feels, minus the faster paces, awards, and actually respectable pr's.

as i thought i'd be going short today, i didnt get started till 8:45, so by the time i finished i was soaked and it was so freakin hot... but i just kept the pace really slow. really slow. now a down day tomorrow, and coast through next week to get a little recovered for early camp. 8 days away!"

hung mid to back pack till rep number 5, where i threw in a surge and moved up to second, rep 6 i stayed relaxed and pushed up to the lead. the girl's last repeat i gave emma a 15-20 meter lead, but lyndsi just crushed the last 200m, to give sam the lead in the men's last repeat. he got out maybe 4 seconds ahead of me, and he tried, gotta give him that. figured hed go out fast, so i let him, caught him around the quarter, then laid into it the final 300m. with 150 to go, I threw up the '#1', hoping to anger him enough to kick me down. never happened, closed in 2:12 ftw.

Then, inside of a mile to go, we're running down sunrise and this car drives by and honks. naturally, I flip them off, and continue on my way. 5 minutes later the car comes back, pulls along side me and rolls down the window. the approximately 17-18 year old driver with his girlfriend in the passenger seat leans out and says 'I'll put you in a snowbank you faggots' not realizing that fighting someone on a run has been my dream for 4 years and bartley is a world champ wrestler. So I say everything I can to get him to stop. I tell him to pull over, get out, come back, etc... I tell him to come over and talk about this. he continues down the road and pulls in to the high school track parking lot.

recently, bartley has been dying to do some MMA and Anderson Silva someone in the jaw, so I look at him and ask if hes down for a fight. He complies, and now i'm 100% to destroy this kid, and then offer to take his girlfriend on a date. we get up by the parking lot and he pulls out, flips us off and drives away.

In retrospect I should have insulted his gf, as then he'd have to stop to defend her honor. however, she must already think he's an immature tool for acting that way, and insulting her would have decreased my chances of making out with her while bartley forced her turd boyfriend to watch.

That being said, we're pretty skeptical of the deer on this run. They had it in for us. saw tons, and not only did they try to flank us, they also chased us, followed us, cut us off.

Wont complain about that. 7 minute miles for the first 2, then dropped to 6:35's for the rest, and at mile 5 even the 6:35 pace felt so ludicrously easy that i put the incline at 3.5 for 2 miles just so i could sweat a little, feel like i was actually doing something. ran miles 7-10 @ 6:30 pace and 0 incline, and felt like i was running downhill. kinda neat. finished with 4x1:00 @ 14 mph (4:16 pace), although i put the wheel on the treadmill and determined that at '14 mph' it's actually going 4:06 pace. i'm sure friction of a runner slows it down some though. after the initial flurry of quick strides at that pace i was actually able to run at that speed and feel relaxed, so after the season is over I'm going to try to hold on for a mile at full speed. not having to push off (forward) makes running on a treadmill so much easier than running on real ground.

really flippin hard to figure out how to run 10k pace during indoor on an indoor track.

part of the problem was the track traffic, and the guy in the wheelchair PARKED in lane one on the curve. came through the mile both times around 5:11 or 5:12. the pace was awkward, cuz it was faster than threshold pace but slower than any track work ive done so far.

God is merciful. then down on bridges I saw a six pack plastic ring thing hanging from a tree with a beer can in it. after a few steps I stopped, because no one puts empties back in the rings. It was off the road in the trees across where it was flooded. Mark and I walked across the mud and water, and the beer can was full and unopened. Again, God is merciful. Anytime a flood carries away a beer and deposits it at mile 9, you take it. So mark and I drank it on the side of the road.

last run with the team as a whole, as a lot of them will end their seasons tomorrow. so per tradition, I stashed a cooler of beer in the arb, and we all went and had a toast at the end of the run. While I'm not thrilled with what I've done here, today's run - maybe it was just the nice weather - made me really reflect on how far I've actually come in college. I ran across the starting line in the arb from my first college race (less UND) and remembered being that out of shape dreamer with the 18:30 5k pr and 37 something in the 10k. maybe my trials haven't been so fruitless. and who knows. maybe there'll be more after I leave this place."

I came around the corner and he freaked out. grabbed all his stuff and in a panic stuffed it in a pocket and biked away. Like the doesn't look obvious. As for the kids all mocking me, it may be, perhaps, that I'm currently flabby and slow and am not as physically intimidating as when I'm in shape and fast. Not that anyone really notices the difference.

As for the running, I've gone soft. My first mile felt like i was doing an easy tempo workout. just in the sense that my turnover felt quick and my footstrike felt light. split my first mile and it was 7:12.

the seconds 10k was not as fun. I was never out of control, or completely dead, but keeping that pace required some work, and a lot of concentration. started out @5:18's, picked it up a bit with 2 miles to go, closed in a 5:07.

well, I measured out a route to do this on that's fairly flat, but didn't think about the 20+ mph wind. turns out my first 1/3 of a mile was straight into it, then it was at my side, and I only had it behind me for the last quarter mile. When I'm fighting wind, I have NO IDEA what kind of pace I'm running, because I can't gauge my effort. wanted to run 5:20 pace and feel relaxed, well, i opened the first half mile in 2:30 - into the wind mind you - and felt gassed the rest of the way. second one, opened in 2:35, still felt gassed.

oh well, yesterday felt amazing, and I still hit the times today, even if it was closer to 10k effort.

Out and back on the mountain today - about a mile in I had to just stop and stare. The run was mostly on this gravel narrow winding road where one side was the mountain, the other was a cliff, and off the cliff you could see the entire Rogue Valley. Absolutely breathtaking. Ran down the mountain, through the vineyards, then flipped it and came back up. Unreal - we simply do not have hills like this in MN. For the gusties out there, the last half mile of this run was actually worse than Challenge. But I have chills. This place is amazing."

Got up at 7 and had coffee on the coast of Oregon sitting on a piece of drift wood, went back inside, changed, and while I was inside it started POURING. 15 miles, along the coast in the pouring rain. so perfect. I was on cloud 9 and just floating the whole way. At one point I did swing across the road and went up into the hills - redwood trees taller than I can explain, meadows, cottages, tiny, winding, gravel roads.... Everything was green. Almost like I imagine Ireland would be. One of my favorite runs of all time."

Unbelieveable. Best kept-up park I've ever seen. Google search that shit. miles and miles of wood chip trails along the creek; everything smelled like fresh cedar. I saw a gate across a dirt road that said no motorized vehicles beyond this point, so I ran up it. Again, straight up a freaking mountain (one of the Siskiyou mountains). Completely by myself, serene... I felt so at peace running through the woods, past waterfalls... not another human for miles. Breathtaking views.... and ashland is like northfield. Young, college town, not a single chain store or restaurant. I could live here. Perhaps I shall. To reinforce how quickly runs go here, I looked at my watch for the first time figuring I was about 3-4 miles in... 52 minutes.

Finished this off with a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich from cafe 116, and a wonderful cup of coffee. This cafe is on the same plane as colossal. Fantastic, tiny, and a lot of hippies. just sat, ate, and watched the cars drive by.

That mf'er never ONCE flattened out. just straight climbing. When I finally got to the top the road still went up more somehow. Riddle me the physics of that... Bottom line, I'll never complain about hills again, and minnesotans are pussies. I never dreamt my tiddler could be diddled so hard. But it was worth every step of anguish. I love this place.

odd feeling, running that slow. I eventually started hurdling things and skipping and dancing and such.

Ran with JL and Kurt, and had a dandy time. I would venture a guess that we were quite a bit under 7:08 pace, but I want to be safe with the distance, and the trails can be deceiving. 

Helped a unique fellow take a 'REAL RIVER MONSTER' off of his hook, and proceeded to laugh myself silly at the ridiculous crap he was saying, and his mannerisms. I cannot believe that happened. 'I'm a real bad boy for catching this out of season!!' You bet you are, fucking weirdo. 

He named the northern, 'lucia'. Unfortunately I had no advice for him regarding how he should wash his gloves. Kurt made us run all over creation cuz he navigates like a 16 year old girl, and I happened to educate a man and his two kindergarten-aged sons about sexual escapades when I failed to see them ahead of me. 

Stopped at Lunds on our way back and packed our bodies full of refined sugar, saturated fat, and other excellent foods. Days like this are the reason I run."

Fine by me, I enjoy the sights and sounds, yes? However they have a flipping stationary bike and all their crap in lanes 1 and 2, and the rest of the lanes are blocked by hurdles. So, my ladder workout essentially was scrapped, and I did what I could with the options I had. I just wanted to do something that would leave my legs feeling snappy, but still get some volume in, so I did 10x300 with 500 jogging recovery, more or less continuous.

49, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 49, 49, 48

I had more in the tank during the final 5, but after inhaling bugs and a coughing fit I got a nuisance side-ache that then decided how fast I was going to be allowed to run.

Me: Would it be ok if I just ran with you guys? That way I don't have to run before, and then do it?
Mom: Sure! I think we're just going to go around the Cannon River on the Cannon Valley Trail.

*We drive to the CVT, the run commences*

Me: Well, we're in Welch now (mile 10.5 or so), and there's a drinking fountain at the park. Mind if I grab some water?
Mom: Go ahead.

*Stretching, drinking* 

Me: So... we gonna wrap this up soon or what? How are we getting back from here?
Mom: Um... We're just turning around??
Me: ....... You're..... um.... *bewilderment* You realize this is going to end up being a 21 mile run for me, right?
Mom: Don't you like, do that every day anyway?
Me: Good god. Ok Lets go.

I promptly sat down in the river when we got back, dried off, made her drive me to DQ, and brought $16 worth of ice cream.

Happy Mother's Day.

We did have to stop at an intersection for a car, and traffic being the great equalizer of racing ability, he caught back up. We 'tied' but I made sure to clearly finish ahead of him for my own pride. We shook hands, said good race, and went our separate ways...

I felt good today.

Then we decided to go out, have a beer, a shot of... rum? stayed out till 2 am, I drove people home, a chick puked in my back seat (into the waiting arms and shirt of a friend, much better than I'd ever be) and then we slept for... ALMOST 4 hours, drove to Lino Lakes and ran. I am NOT in 5k shape. Not that I was 'racing' by any means, but i was at least solidly moving. It was me, a UST kid, and then no one. HE took it out hard and I was winded and literally contemplated giving up by 400m, but he had back fat so I settled on his shoulder and hung out. Then I decided to not be a dick and just sit and kick, so at a bit before mile 1 I pulled away and yo yo'd the pace a bit to test him out. It was an out and back (turn around a cone) and a pretty technical course as far as paved trails go. Lots of hairpins, and a long, soft wood bridge. I pulled away from this kid just far enough to not hear his breathing, and anytime I could hear him I just surged again.

Kept it contained today, and it felt easy. the 200's were all 31's.

Helped to have Gangles there so I didn't feel like I was alone in the universe, even though we weren't running together. Also there were two chicks out there and we kinda cheered for each other a bit. John informed me that (at least one of them) was an OT qualifier. I kinda figured cuz they weren't moving slowly.

Felt springy fresh, but apprehensive at the start. Rolled 3 miles at MP, roughly 5:45's, and then got on the track. Plan was 3x(800, 1000, 1600) at 5:20 pace with pretty limited recovery. JL was with on this, and I think that made a huge difference as we shared pacing duties. It's a lot easier to run repeats when you only have to think for part of them. Ended up going
2:37, 3:16, 5:21
2:40, 3:19, 5:20
2:39, 3:18, 5:07

Felt actually kind of enjoyable. We were on and off kinda chatty out there, which helped keep it light. I think, too (and we talked about this) that there's a very definite feedback loop with running. When it goes well, you get excited, which makes things feel better, which makes the reps go better, repeat, etc. Or if it's crappy, your beat yourself up, suck even more, beat yourself up more, etc.

Today was kinda sorta mostly fun. Cooler weather, having John, feeling good.... all culminates in a positive experience. The last mile I led through 800 in 2:40, then John took over - and apparently my race instincts. Maybe it was because it was the last rep.... but with 300 to go I felt good, and slammed down hard on the button. Jiggy-esque, if you will - just slower. my last 300 had to be 47-48, which is not that fast, but for how smooth it felt, and to cap off a 26.5 mile day? damn right I'll take it."

I think a big part of that is that I feel like I'm just in maintanence mode right now, and have been all winter. That said, I feel like I don't deserve to be running fast. Sure I'll go give it everything I have, but I have some definite cognitive dissonace between what I'm doing (dicking around, getting out the door each day) and who I am inside as far as training goes (see: jdelehanty). I definitely will get back to it again, I just don't have it in my soul when it's cold out, and I have work and school. Excuses... Translate: I'm kinda a bitch. But it;s fun enough, I'm healthy, and give me 6 weeks of actually doing aomething and I'll round into form.

Warm Up: 3 miles
Race Splits: 3:04, 6:02, 9:00
Cool Down: 3 miles
Overall Place: 8/21

Love me some 9 minute 3k's... So, they figured it's be pretty sweet to put 21 guys in a single 3k heat on an indoor track. We did alley starts, and I was on the inside. The outside got out ahead of us, and when they collapsed in I found myself nicely shitcanned in the back. Not usually a problem, but when we were running 37 second laps, it becomes an issue. Spent a lot of time in lanes 2 and three, and once made a desperate attempt to get around the shit and ran in lane 4. Good tactics. Anyway, running 10 minute mile pace was conducive to some light chatting with Colin Rogers. I saw Leaf and gave him a headshake accompanied with some pointing at the pack - he mentioned something about 'hanging out' and I knew he got my predicament. Everyone tucked in on the curve and surged on the straights so it was literally impossible to get around anyone. So Merchant and I just kept on galloping along in the back. Stopped looking at my splits - Oh, and they set up hurdles in lane 3 when we (I) was still running in it. That was neat. Anyway, with 1k to go I was in 20th, finished in 8th. It may have been a slow time, but I raced well for the situation, and wasn't tired at the end. Some people just race like idiots."

Joe just raced 10k, I was tying up a 15 mile day and have no leg speed, and bart had on jeans and dress shoes. Joe put on a clinic and came home in 59 (put 7 seconds on me in the last 275) I ran 66, bart was 68.

SO I went back to a light, quick pace until 700m where I threw in a 75 or so meter surge and gapped the field except erica's boyfriend who was to some degree racing seriously. He came with and I pulled him into the bell at an almost reasonable pace. Went over the water barrier and cannonballed into the steeple pit. soaked up to my collar bones. Erica's bf went over it like a normal human and put 20m on me before I could climb out and start plodding again.

It was awesome running with them on our recovery jogs, fake racing them during that time, high fiving, cheering for each other... fun to see so many little kids doing a sport I love. Pretty inspiring both directions, I think. Anyway, we did 16x400 with 200m jog and 30 seconds of passive recovery.

I'm as rested as I'm going to be, I think, and today begins what is, on paper, my largest 3 week training cycle ever. I'm reserving myself the right to audible on it if I feel like it's going to hurt my racing. I'm sure I'll be tired for any/all workouts I do, so I'm not sure if sacrificing a little there will be bad or not. On recovery days, I'm going to run about as slowly as I possibly can. God willing, I can stay in one piece. My biggest concern is actually going to be getting enough sleep. It's hard to stay rested at even just 100 miles.

If anyone wants company on runs, hit me up these next three weeks. Otherwise I'll be spending a lot of time with my own thoughts. I wish my resident training partner would hurry his ass up and get home... That'd help too."

Last year my second 10k was 32:12, if I recall.

This year, I actually ended up doing 2x6miles out on the cedar lake trails, and for pace, all I wanted was something under 6:00/mile and for it to feel smooth. Stayed far away from the well on this one, as I'd like to still do mile repeats on Friday.

First, I think God was testing me because I had a guy trying to pass me for probably a half mile before he finally just surged and did it, but once he got about 10 meters ahead, he slowed back to exactly my pace. Now this dude... He was my dream slow-roll package: He had an Ipod armband, a pony tail, a headband, a heart rate monitor, long shorts, and was heel striking in Vibrams. Literally the one day of 2013 that I wouldn't take the bait. so we circled Isles 25 feet apart.

Then, on Cedar, this lady was running toward me, attractive, but not like... crazy hot. A fit, early 30's woman with a little Latina in her or something. Anyway, I don't know what I did or how I looked, but as I went by she said, 'I'm a little too old for ya, hun.' Still not sure what to make of that.

Good enough day as far as effort goes, too close to the big week for it to really be any sort of quality. That's the last 'strength' workout of this cycle. EASY progressive long run this weekend, then it's all raw speed until the half!

The red wings/flyers game was on, and I actually don't mind watching hockey, so that was cool. Also, some other sitcom was on so I intermittently payed attention to that. Funny excerpt from it:

Mom driving a minivan while her elementary-aged daughter is in the back seat.

Daughter: I think I like a boy.
Mom: Oh yeah? Tell me about him.
Daughter: He likes the swings, and sits by the flags. And he can count to 100.
Mom: Well gosh! He sounds like the complete package!
Daughter: Just one problem...
Mom: What's that?
Daughter: I don't think he notices me...

Other than the bike path along the river, the dam, and across the dike, The trails were clear. Pavement. 37 degrees and wet pavement at that. And anyone who knows me knows how excited I get about running on wet pavement. It felt like a glorious spring day out there today, and after a galavantingly slow first 4 miles I couldn't keep the demons back any longer and I started to float some quicker miles. 5:50's, mostly. Wasn't hard, by any means, but I could tell two things: 1) my legs have some volume in them from this skiing nonsense and 2) I have not done any sort of fast-twitch activation work in For. Ev. Er. So I at least did a half dozen hard strides at the end. 

I did get the welcome home I expected from the Hastings community. Good for them for not progressing a bit in their ignorant na�vety. I was wearing spandex tights, a t-shirt with a half zip over it, and a baseball cap. Normal, yes? Somewhere along the river a woman - who interrupted her own phone call to tell me something - said, 'It disgusts me that you think it's ok to just wear spandex in public.' I put on my biggest shit-grin and kindly said back, 'Happy holidays! Isn't it a beautiful day out?' Then I proceeded to prance my spandex-clad self away so as to no longer disturb her delicate psyche. Then, crossing 55 on Pleasant (I actually waited my turn to cross today) I was crossing in the crosswalk, on green, and even had the little walk light. So totally in the clear, no? Well eastbound traffic was stopped on red, cars in both lanes. This dude in the right turn lane (ostensibly unable to see me as I was obscured by the cars) rolls right through the cross walk, like he is going to turn right (on red, mind you) without even considering stopping. I put my hand out to brace myself, and he braked, but way too late. So I did the only logical thing, and that was to jump on the hood of his minivan/suv looking thing. I jumped off the other side, and kept running, when the driver decided to honk at me. I turned around, flipped him off, and saw that it was a high school aged boy, and he was screaming something at me behind closed windows. So I gestured for him to come over. He pulls up along side of me by the library, rolls down his window and says, 'Stay out of the fucking road! Do you not know what a highway is? There are sidewalks for a reason.' I replied, cavalierly, (all while still running 6 minute pace) 'Have you never heard of a crosswalk? In fact, it's that thing that connects those two sidewalks that I was running on. And your light was red. And I had a walk light. Stay in school - I know these are all really challenging concepts.'

He said something about kicking my ass and then drove off. It was nice out, I had some adrenaline pumping, and I kind of wish he would have tried that.

One guy stopped and offered a ride up Franklin hill - said he saw the fall - but I felt like i needed to keep it moving. so after a few minutes and massaging I limped a bit, and somehow made it the 7 miles home. as long as my footfall is completely flat and straight, I could run fine. any sort of non-level surface, turns, or hills, and nuh-uh. As I write this in the morning, it's tender to the touch, and there's some discoloration. I certainly sprained it, to some degree. I don't bruise, so this is unique. As long as the bones are intact, which I'm certain they are.

At about 2hrs 45 I started to bonk. 3 hours is a long way to go on a cup of coffee and a bunch of happy thoughts.

Then the wheels came off. high 7's for 10, well over 8's for 11, then I couldn't run anymore. There was nothing left to burn, and I was getting kind of dizzy. So I walked the last half mile home.

The race started out and Anders and 2 other guys went to the front, and then a group of 10 or so of us skied behind. At the final right-turning uphill before the downhill leading to the wall, I moved to get up to the front of our group, and as I was passing a Fulton dude I was shoved off the side of the trail. My right ski sunk under a foot of powder, and I went down. Couldn't stand back up either, because my right pole was under my ski, under the snow. So I quickly took my strap off, stood up, climbed back onto the trail, put my pole back on and took off all by my lonesome. I would guess it took 20ish seconds. From that point on, it was just a sprint because I was determined to catch the guy who pushed me. With a little under 2k to go I saw people again, and I caught one, then another, and then with maybe 1200 left I saw the Fulton guy. V2'd harder than I probably ever have, got up to him, and then he splayed his poles and started skiing back and forth across the trail, so I couldn't go by. Got a little pissed, cuz this is wednesday night at elm, not the World Cup, and just skied across the tops of his skis. Went by. Beat him. Couldn't reel Kory back in, which was the goal at the start. Ended up 12th out of 20, 15:34. 

Anders got 3rd, according to the results, but it was a photo finish, and with the blizzard-like conditions, no one could see the finish line (not so much a problem for me, I just stopped when I got to Ander's parents). Trails were well groomed, but had a lot of drifting new snow over them, which sucked a little. Windy as heck out there - felt bad for the classic people, because their tracks were filled with snow.

So, so far so good with surviving winter. 

Today was a ball buster though. Not hard on the whole, but the greenway all the way back from west river was an ice rink. I stopped running and could slide about 10 feet. so that sucked for 4.5 miles.

Skied for 90ish minutes after watching Mar/Alayna/Kiddie easily win the sibling category up at the JNQ. Went north from OO until I met Dr. S, turned around and skied with him until he thought he was going to bonk, then we went back.

Three observations about that man:
1. He knows every single person who skis on the Birkie trails, and will talk to every single one.
2. His quietest voice is JUST edged out for decibel levels by the Boeing AC-130, but people respond to him as if nothing is out of the ordinary - luckily, living with John has me conditioned.
3. If you're ever going to bonk, being with him is a good idea, because it's very likely that he has some half eaten, frozen food item in one of his clothing pockets that he's forgotten about for >7 days

One opened up - probably objectively the least desirable one there. It's in the corner, no TV's, just a blank wall. I didn't bring my iPod either, so I just did that wonderful thing that 10's of thousands of miles does to you, and I just dissociated. Turned it on and went to sleep.

Cut the cool down short because I started getting some pretty bad heartburn? That was strange. Legs were definitely more tired today than when I did a workout last Thursday.

Full strength circuit after.

I've also descended into race-week mode. I know this isn't my sport, but I still find myself with the singular-objective feeling. No question, on Sunday there will be dozens and dozens of stronger skiers in the race than me - and I will lose to every one of them. But since I started logging on here my sophomore year of college, I've run 20,000 miles, who knows how many before that, and if anyone in that field can grind, God knows I can grind with the best of them. Maybe I'll blow up, and I'd be at peace with that, knowing that I tried. That said, I know how to race, and I would not doubt that as far as aerobic strength goes, I'm the strongest person in that field. Looking over the 800 some people who are registered so far, if it were a distance running race on Sunday, I would win.

I got to start in the second to last row of the very last wave, which I knew going into it would be frustrating at times. I probably could have started at the front of my wave, but I stayed in the warming tent unit about 3 minutes before the start. It was like -3, calm and sunny at the start, and I wasn't cold. I was about 6-8 rows of people back, so the gun went off and even though I was double poling as hard as I could, I still was caught in the mess when the trail collapsed. The first 10k was like an interval workout. I'd get caught behind people and ski slower than just casual ski pace, and then I'd see and opening and sprint to the next little aneurysm of skiers and then hang out behind them again. I know that everyone has to start in the back of their first race and work their way forward, and I just kept telling myself that. But my running-racing mentality was absolutely killing me out there. I'd estimate I had to stop (completely stop for some period of time) about 12 times throughout the race. The worst was when the trail for the marathon and the trail for the tour skate combined at a climb just after Wirth Lake, and there were small children trying to climb in front of and next to me. This was also where another Loppet skier skied over the tip of my right ski as I was trying to climb, and I fell. By the time I got to Lake of the Isles, it was finally clear enough that I felt like I could ski my own race. I found a rhythm and began making up ground. Until maybe 6 or 7k to go I felt really energetic - and I thought that if I could have drank something toward the end it would have helped. Buuuut my water bottle was frozen, so I just had to do without. Marit gave me something by 394 - some warm, salty/sweet liquid that I'm sure would taste rancid in normal life, but it was heavenly considering the circumstances. I beat all the Johnnies, catching the last one on Calhoun's east side, but that accomplishment is tainted, because they raced the day before as well. Marit's dad made me look like a child, beating me by like 6 minutes. Of which over 4 of them came in just the first half (he was wave 4, which would still really suck). 

For the circumstances, I'm pretty happy with how it all went. Frustrating, sure, but it was fun. I was the 202nd finisher overall, but adjusted for time from the wave starts (I started 25 minutes back), I placed 91st of 819 finishers, in 2:26:33 - even too since the first 10k was congested, and the last 5k was really tired. My first 21k was only 1 second per mile faster than my second 21k. Of the people who finished, I had to physically ski around 617 other skiers - no small task on the Wirth trails (470 skiers in the first 21k alone). I won my wave, beat all but 2 people from wave 4, all but 5 people from wave 3, everyone in wave 2 (except the two elites who started late), and most of wave 1. I felt strong, energetic, and like I have room to improve. I loved seeing, and a huge thank you, to Marit, Alayna, Kiddie, John, Kate, and anyone else who was out there. Pretty sweet to have that kind of support. It really, really helped.

According to Anders, this finish will put me in the elite wave next year, which I'm excited for for two reasons: 1) I look forward to seeing how I can ski without having to ski thought 5 waves of people, and 2) That will at least assure I can start in wave 3 of the Birkie next year even if I don't do a qualifying race - and that was my goal going in today. 2014: Qualify at CoL for Birkie wave 3, 2015: Qualify at Birkie for the elite wave, 2016: Birkie elite wave vs Steve Sonnesyn head to head.

And now, Me and Anders, 2015, CoL top.... number to be decided later.

As we cleared the woods with 500 to go, I passed him. My firmly held belief that if you're going to make a move, make it hard came to mind and I stepped on what little bit of gas I had left, hoping he'd let me go. I gapped him by 10m and held it, but with just under 100m to go he pulled back even, and we all out sprinted to the finish. All I really had left was to move my arms faster, and it wasn't enough.

Then based on her first name and major I figured out her life story. And I mean life story. I like to believe Finan is still in a fetal position contemplating life right now. In fact I'll post my response here:

Things I knew: Her first name was Madison. She was a comm studies major at GAC. My text to Finan:

'Madison Pettit, from zumbrota Minnesota. Favorite activities are running, horseback riding, spending time with friends. She's interested in a career in sales, marketing, or advertising. She actually worked on a dairy farm, (just like me) milking cows and doing other farm related work. She's quite fond of the actress Kirsten Bell, and would like her to act as her should a movie ever be made about her life. Her parents are Joel and Sarah, originally from new Jersey. They met each other showing cows with their local 4-h club. They were married in July 1983 and lived together seven years before moving to Minnesota together (June 1990). Her moms favorite restaurant is 'newts' because the have the best burgers. Madison has an older sister kalie and a younger brother Jared. While at Gustavus, Madison was a writer for our school paper, and did her senior thesis on the civil war letters of olof Nelson. Her middle name is Marie. She likes cantaloupe and wore a light pink dress for her senior prom. All the men in her family drive Chevy trucks. She took a trip back in 2012 to the grand Cayman islands with her then boyfriend Kyle Olson. She's currently an account coordinator at prestige resorts and destinations. She had an internship at dominium, worked for target,  and ran track and cc in high school. Distance. I can give you prs if you really care. Her twitter handle is madisonpettit. Anything else you want?'

I do really, really think I need to get back on the morning run routine, but I don't have the spirit that Jack has to push through the dark, cold mornings. I know that will help though.

Interestingly, The last 3 discouraging runs I've done I had a dove chocolate immediately after, and every one of them said, 'Believe in yourself'. I opened it today, and thought, no way.

Pretty solid wind on the backstretch, and I had my doubts that I could pull him through very much. He asked for 2:13 through 800, and to my surprise I came around in 2:12.96. A little bit faster the first lap than the second, but nothing too significant. Haven't run that fast in quite some time, and I forgot how the worst part about that sort of speed is the sensation that your throat is on fire. When I pulled off at 800, I felt like kind of a dick making him run the awful third lap solo, and I jumped back in for the last lap.

Anders taught me two things today: 1) that he's a horse and is able to run fast regardless of his current fitness, weather, etc. and 2) apparently the shape of my chest/sternum suggests that I'm 'almost certainly going to die of an aortic aneurism'. I love having medically-minded friends. Just dropping that in casual conversation.

Then, contrary to what that gigantic sack wrote in his log, I didn't insist he run a seven mile cool down with me. I asked what he was doing for his cool down, he said, 'Whatever you are.' I said, 'I don't think you want to do that. I'm going 7.' and he said 'Ok'. I'm not sure who whined more, Anders on the cool down, or me when he said I had to run 66's today.

They also sealed the gap in the fence that we slipped through at the track. Looks like we have to get good at fence climbing, or get skinnier if we want in at SW this summer."

Seriously, I've never seen such a high per capita rate of Lycra before in my life. 

Everyone was just playing fashion model on a 3 mile long catwalk, and I was somehow caught in the middle of the nightmare. I felt so agitated out there, dodging everyone, and I was heckled at least 10 times (shorts, no shirt). I didn't even make it to 31st and Hennepin (0.08 miles) without getting my first condescending comment. 

Spring, I like you, but your seasonal minions can go back to hibernation any time now.

On a positive note, I saw Vest Guy on Calhoun, and again on Harriet, and you guessed it: He had his red zip up on. Sooner or later I'm going to turn and run with him for a while and ask why he always has that damn thing on."

The first 3 were cake, then they became honest, and the last 3 I was just trying to hold form, and relax, relax, relax. Didn't help that there was a 20mph wind, but at least in theory it was at my back part of the time. 60 seconds of recovery really quickly turns into not enough.

Anders and I met up at Southwest after work to do a light workout for our respective assaults on the track this weekend. When we got there, there was a meet going on. Luckily, we drove, so we just went over to Washburn to run our intervals there. When we got there, there was a lacrosse game going on. 0 for 2. We drove to Blake, and their track was clear. We dropped our spikes off and went for a warmup. When we got back, there were probably 100 people with disabilities on the track - turns out there's special olympic track practice there from 6:30 to 7:30. We asked the coach if they used all the lanes, and she said yes. So having exhausted our usual options, we decided St. Louis Park's track was close enough, so we went there. Track meet. By this time, the meet at SW was probably over, but it seemed silly to go back, so we went to Hopkins. Their track was empty. We climbed the fence, and had the whole track to ourselves as the sun was slowly setting. Calm, cool, it was almost romantic.

Anders had a mess of 300's on the 2 minute, and I had 8x400 with 90 seconds rest. I didn't look at my watch on the first one, because the effort was more important than a number today (though I had an idea of splits in my head). I wanted them to be really relaxed. I started my first one, and just ran easy, lightly. It was a 68, which is exactly what I was thinking they'd be today. So I decided on straight 68's the whole way.

Went: 68, 68, 67, 68, 67, 68, 67, 64 (the 64 was 68 pace, but I flipped on the burners for the final 100m). All in all, this workout felt good. Easy. 90 seconds of rest felt like a lifetime. 

Anders executed his workout perfectly as well - I think if conditions are good this weekend (doubtful) we'll be ready to scald. 

What a day. 9:44 pm and I'm just now getting to dinner. Walking across the Hopkins parking lot, it dawned on me that for the time we spent looking for a track today we could have driven to GAC, warmed up, and been a few reps in by the time we finally found one. Oh well. Now it's time to rest."

I didn't know how fast these should be, so I figured I'd cruise around marathon effort, and it'd be what it would be. I met the German legend, Otto Maxwell Renner, at the East Calhoun beach, and we went off frolicking to the greenway. Just over 3 miles on the warmup, and away we went. My nose was running and my eyes were watering the whole time, which was irritating. I must have looked like a mess. My breathing and heart rate also didn't get under control until mile 7 of the uptempo bit, which additionally was frustrating. I wasn't... working hard, but my insides thought I was.

The cemetery is awesome for rolling intervals, as the grounds out there are like Griak, and there are a TON of roads/trails to run on.

First mile was 7:31, then 6:40, and then miles 3-10 were all 5:52-6:00. Whoops. Felt easy enough though. Should have worn heavier shoes??

On William Berry, I met a fellow at the stoplight who had on a heart rate monitor, iPod armband, hydration belt with two bottles (that I saw), visor, sunglasses... Straight up Lifetime Fitness poster child. He asked how far I was going, I told him 10. He said, 'Don't you need to hydrate?' I told him I had some water before I left.

Legs and body felt a bit tired today, which I suppose is to be expected. after some soul-searching I decided against racing tomorrow. Partially because I've done some work over the past few days and don't feel quick, but mostly because my heart just isn't there right now. After considering the distance and time investment, compared with the best possibly outcome, it just isn't worth it to me. Sad that to get a competitive meet these days you have to drive to either La Crosse, Rock Island IL, Naperville IL, Hillsdale MI, or once in a great while Souix Falls SD.

There are 7 guys at LaX between 14:38 and 15:04, so it'd be a good train to ride, but if I fell short, I think I'd be pretty disappointed. So, a few more days of getting stronger, then maybe Kraft."

The only time I actually noticed it was the third mile, where it kind of sucked a little. When I turned by 169 the mile time dropped (I think because I was still giving the same effort that I had been into the wind, so I backed off when I saw the split). Marit biked with me, which was pretty awesome, because as much as I love my own thoughts, or having the same line of the same song on replay in my head for 2 hours, it was awesome having someone else talking to me, even though I couldn't be super chatty back. It also eliminated the fabricated competition I sometimes feel when I'm doing a workout like this with one of the guys. It was just... Casual. I felt like we were out for an afternoon activity together. Good stuff. The pace felt really relaxed - I got a bit of a stomach ache somewhere during mile 8 maybe, but it wasn't bad. Greenway west standard loop, home via the sculpture garden. When I hit the last mile, I was feeling itchy - not sure if it's because I wanted to burn, or I wanted to be done, but either way I picked it up to (but not across) the red line. I was still running relaxed, no pressing, no kicking, no going to the well, I just aired it out a bit. Happy with the workout.

I would switch sides of the road or adjust my pace to not have to pass/interact with anyone. I still don't understand why I hate seeing people on morning runs so much. I like doing morning runs with people, but man do I hate seeing other people out waling/running/whatever. In the afternoons, it's totally fine, even appreciated. Strange.

Observation: There are SO MANY youngish mom's with toddlers on King's. There's a definite cohort that lives there. The seemingly newer moms were just pouring out of their homes with their running caps and strollers, maybe a dog by their side. I couldn't believe how many there seemed to be. Maybe it's a club. I wouldn't have guessed that area would be starter family homes, but reflecting on it, I think it would be a really good area if you weren't ready to leave the city yet, but wanted some tranquility. I think those houses are expensive though... Also, everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY that lives there drives a late model minivan, audi, or volvo. Period. every single one. There was maybe a stray prius or two that ventured too far from uptown. Anyway, I'm digressing. Good run. 8 + minute pace for the first 2 miles. Love it."

It wasn't until the 8th 100 that Anders realized we'd started the workout. Some mis-communication, but it's still embarrassing that 7 times I had been running as fast as I could, and he legitimately didn't realize we'd started the workout.

Had to add on a little, which was a sad realization, but it worked out. I had a healthy breakfast, but then forgot to eat any sort of lunch, and when I got home Andes was at my house - I ate two packs of Jelly Belly sport beans and a banana power bar (why I had that flavor, I don't know) and went about my jogging.

We sat back for a while while she gapped up and I thought back to the darkest day of my past, 8/5/2013, the only other time someone ran past me and I didn't get them back. So, I was immature again, downshifted to 5:50's and went back past her, turned off the trail and went home. Saw John heading out on Isles while we were coming home - he yelled at me for wearing short shorts, I yelled at him for being on the bike path.

In unrelated news, I was 17th in the 5k. Which is gun timing because it's a championship race. I know this, and i agree with it. That said, by chip timing, I was 16th, and I beat Marotz ;) is that polishing a turd? Sure. But I have to say I beat Jake when I can, even if I didn't actually beat him."

Did sort of some unstructured speed: Mile, 60 seconds, Mile, half mile jog w/bathroom break, another mile... 5:20, 5:18, 5:17. The first two miles were just floating (a bit fast considering I had squishy Pegasus's on) but the last 2 minutes of the last mile felt tiring. As soon as we finished the last mile, maybe a second after, I took off sprinting because the rule is I can do that any time I want and Anders has to catch me. I could tell he wouldn't be interested in it, so I did it. It wasn't fun for me either, though. Achillies was a bit sore on the cool down, but feels fine as I type this. Marit has really good technique - even though this was one of her first times out this year. And she could single-stick as fast as we could run. So there's that.

I almost didn't get out for the run, because she kept telling me that it was too hot, so I promised her I'd be back before Jeopardy was over, which I of course had no intention of doing. Didn't know where to go, so I just hodge-podged around. Actually pretty awesome. I forget how many cool places there are to run in Hastings. I took the Vermillion River Trail across the falls, through cow town, over to Lake Rebecca, Along the river to the lock and dam, across the dike (which was great - a nice cross wind coming off the water), and back via Pleasant. 

Only a thousand or so degrees, but I can't complain. Achillies was alright. Contemplated whether or not it'd be possible to survive a jump over the wood bridge across the falls. I doubt it, but I'd be willing to try."

Running on the Luce Line was good for my legs. The downside was that the crushed rock wasn't giving me my whole purchase for the HM miles, but I don't care about that.

I was able to bike along with Alayna and Marit after my run for their run. I enjoyed that.

That said, after the race I wouldn't have to travel anywhere, the fan support is fantastic, and I'd like to think I could be top 25 or better overall on a good day. I didn't have a spectacular race in 2012 and I was 36th. I feel like I should be able to better that mark. 

In any case, Summer training is finally here, no races on the horizon to worry about being ready for, and all the time in the world to just train and get strong. I'm feeling really, really excited. I'm going to also do some strength/core work at least 3 times/week to start, and I'll log it on here for accountability.

Trials of miles. I'm sure I'll miss racing, but right now, I just want to run :)"

Great weather out there, though. Strength + Core after. I gave a lot of thought today to my fall racing plans.

I bet I lost 5% of my body weight today. I had no idea I was retaining so much water, and no idea where I was keeping it all. That solved the bloated feeling I've had the past few days, and I felt much lighter and less... puffy the last 5 or so miles. I don't know why a body would retain so much fluid for s long, and then just purge all at once, unless someone slipped me some Furosemide? Anders? Is this a joke to you?

That's the last time I do that. Every stereotype about Lifetime runners is true. First of all, a bunch of them showed up. A whole freak flapping flock of 'em. They all had on visors, oversized tri half tights, arm bands with huge phones/music players, and at least one guy was wearing a water belt. I sat quietly in my corner in my short shorts while they all tried on wear-test asics (which were all 4mm heel-toe drop, and they ate that right up.) They sat around talking about trail ultras and how one particularly tan guy there ran 'a marathon every week' (meaning he routinely ran 26 miles/week, not the race) and how he must burn through trainers. 

Then some dude from some rehab place by Run n Fun came over and asked if anyone wanted to try out the cryo chamber. Look it up. Anyway, it's a cool machine, but I see no benefit to using it pre run. The rep for the rehab place said that he 'guarantees that if you use the chamber pre-run, it will take 15% long to fatigue during the run' ...I'd like to see the research on that.

BUT, the group ate it up, and they all had to go do it. so the 6pm start time became 6:45, while I sat around and they binged on their gimmicks. Lifetime. No thanks. Those guys are about as serious about running as Dan Greeno is about maintaining a heterosexual image in public.

So we finally start, and they all want to run 10+ minute pace. Except one guy. Maybe a few years older than me. He takes off like a rabbit. I follow curiously, and ask him his story. Former UST student, runs 3-4 times per week when he's 'training seriously' but he's cruising. He didn't run in college, but ran a marathon 7 years ago in 3:58. He kept ratcheting it down, and I felt aerobically fine, so I just shadowed him. we went 6:46, 6:20, 6:05, 6:03, 6:08, 6:05, 6:11, 6:21 and then he pulled the plug. I was actually pretty impressed. He got to be breathing pretty hard by the end and I put in a few slow surges to see if he'd respond, but he really didn't. I never tried to roll him, it was just curiosity, and I felt like playing. 

Faster than I planned to run today, and my right lateral gastruc was still really sore, but I can feel the adhesions with light palpitations and it's in the muscle, so I'm not worried. Onward and upward."

It's not like today was even anything special, but this just makes certain that I won't hit 100 miles this week. Even though coming into 2014, I had one goal - to train intelligently, and not focus on the number - it's hard putting that into practice.

Paul Douglas says a heat index of >100 today, so I went early. So did everyone else, as it turns out. As I made my way down the standard morning King's route, the women of South Dupont were out in full force. We're talking battalions of them. It was like some strange post-modernist performance that resembled a mash up of a core power yoga class, Lululemon on Black Friday, and the beaches of Normandy circa 1944. By this point my calf was loose and life was looking up, so I happily navigated the waves of strollers and made my way down to the creek. Maybe 4 miles in, I spied off in the distance some creature tethered to a lady, and in my morning grogginess/heat delusions, I momentarily had an honest notion that is was Falkor the Luck Dragon from The Neverending Story, but once I realized that wasn't possible, my mind immediately went to, 'oh, it must be a sheep'. Equally unlikely, and substantially amusing, I chuckled to myself. When I caught up, I asked her what kind of dog it was (clearly should have been my first assumption). Turns out, it's an Irish Wolfhound. And that's what it looked like. This skinny, long haired, tall wolf-creature that must have jumped in the creek at some point. Today, I would have too if I had a fur coat.

Navigated the rolling hills of the 40th street bikeway, and made it home in one piece. Two days in a row now, I haven't run and thought about how many miles I had left to go; that's a good feeling. My calf still isn't right, but it doesn't hurt, either. I just.... feel my Flexor Hallucis wrapping around from my heel to my lateral gastruc. A few more days like this, and I'll be ready to load it a bit, and see how it handles the stimulus. Came home to a freezing cold glass of tea and a bowl (Yes Marit, the whole container) of Chop Chop salad - perhaps my new favorite salad.

Set out for a little workout today, and honestly, I felt like my legs were tired, my head was tired, and I really wanted to just stay in, watch a movie and eat jellybeans. And probably have a beer. But apparently I'm still pursuing this running thing, races are coming onto the horizon, and like Andy Rishavy always says...

So I settled on rolling-hill threshold 1200's in the cemetery. Given the 80 degrees, humidity, and fact that I haven't run 'fast' in over a month, I backed off my goal pace to 5:20's (4:00 per 1200). 60 seconds rest.

Ended up running really inconsistent splits of 4:00, 4:01, 4:05, 4:03, 4:07, 4:06

The good and bad is that I felt like I actually ran threshold today, just sucks that threshold pace is that slow right now. It'll come back. 2 months ago I did 8 of these in 3:46-3:55 all chatty - that has to still be in my legs somewhere :)"

Snelling/Pike Island Loop. Gosh it felt good to be back down there. The first 4 miles didn't feel great but then I was able to  click right along. Only saw 2 other people the whole time - such a nice change from the lakes. I love it down there.

It was noticeable that it had been flooded - a few sandy spots on the south side of Pike, and some trees down throughout, but hurdling them brought me right back to my 2009 2nd place finish in the MIAC steeple. Glory days.

Had a few sciatic twinges during the run, but they went away really quickly. I'm sure my legs are just tired. I had a fleeting thought to do some hill repeats on that awful climb below the fort... Nope."

It's amazing how much of a motivator self-loathing can be. I half-heartedly planned to do a workout this morning, but when my alarm went off at 6, I had no legitimate intention of even waking up. Then I hit the weather app on my phone, and saw it was going to be 83 today. 'Just go for an easy run', I told myself. No. eff that.... I closed my eyes. I laid there on the cusp of sleep for a few minutes thinking of how much of a wimp I would be if I skipped running. 'Just sit up and see how it feels'. I sat up, put my feet on the floor and scanned my body for reasons why it'd be best to just take the morning off. I found none. 'Walk downstairs and put on some coffee, you can decide then'. Man, I hated myself. I hated myself for wanting to skip it, for contemplating skipping it, for knowing in my heart of hearts that in a very short time those shoes would be slipping over my feet. I knew how much better my afternoon would be, though, if I just went and did it.
 
I settled on 8 miles @ just slower than threshold. Fast enough that it wasn't fun, slow enough that I could still daydream. I didn't know what that would be, but I was guessing 5:40's. Rolling hills for most of the way.

3 mile w/u, 3 mile c/d

5:31, 5:41, 5:41, 5:37, 5:39, 5:34, 5:41, 5:36 = 45:00 for 8 miles

Parish came up on me on his bike mid-workout, and we chatted for a bit. He's in a tough place right now, but it'll get better. It was reassuring that I could converse at that pace.

John had some wisdom about breaking rocks, and it sounds like his trip was fun. West Coast bound  in 15 hours. Running isn't going to be my focus the next week, and that's fine by me."

Then we went across the bridge and back, which was cool, but really scary to look either up or down. The vertical beams of the bridge went into the low-hanging clouds. Added on two miles solo, and 6 strides after. Felt good! Had the best meal I've probably ever had at a restaurant last night. To anyone going to San Francisco: Pacific Catch at Golden Gate Park."

Lots of weaving through some pretty cool trees, and then when it popped back out to the road we sort of just explored. A bit on the roads, a bit on some more trails, then I added on 3 or 4 miles solo. Felt really smooth and ran a bit fast at the end. Followed this up with a nature hike at Trillium Falls, I fell off a tree that I was climbing down from (full yard sale, in the words of John), ate tons of wild blackberries with Marit, and contemplated the lives of bears.

So we did that, and drove to Eugene for our run. Did this run mostly on Pre's trails, with an out and back in the middle to pay homage to Pre's rock. Lots of hill climbing once we left the trails, but I suppose I should have expected that. Seeing where Pre died helped shed some light on why it happened. driving drunk, at night on those tiny, twisty, hilly roads would be suicide. There's no way you'd see a car coming from the other direction. The trails were cool, a really nice surface, but they kind of just went through a flat open field for a lot of the way. Parts were cool, but it mostly felt like running through a fairground. My GI tract was pretty upset during this run, and Mar wan't feeling great after either. The coffee? Anyway, cool to say I've run there now. Strides after."

After a super fun night - probably the most memorable of the trip - and a whole pizza/app/cake/ice cream, this run felt really good. We started just walking for a few blocks while looking for some parkway that I'd read about. We never found it so we just started running, and less than a quarter mile in, we found ourselves in the middle of a farmers market that was probably 4 blocks long, both sides of the road, and had live music and food vendors. We ended up cutting down to the river and running along that until we got back to our car. We then walked back to the farmers market for really yummy peaches, coffee, and breakfast bagel sandwiches. It was sunny, 70 or so, and perfect out. I had a lot of fun in this city, and I think Mar did too. Definitely had a Minneapolis vibe to it. Superficially, we have more places to run, but it also seemed like they had fewer lululemon joggers. I think we'll be back :)"

Last night, and again this morning we walked around Pike Island Market, which was cool, but a confusing layout - as it turns out, I have no spatial representation abilities. Luckily Marit has that part figured out and we managed just fine. Lots of good seafood last night overlooking the Sound, and a cool sunset over the mountains. What a week."

I wanted to do 16x400 w/90 seconds recovery at 70 or under, but my legs were tired when I started it, and I kind of just checked out when it got hard, which was by rep #3.

I was planning to get up at 7, got up at 6:53 (actually 8:53) and realized I missed Marit's race :( I threw on some shorts, jumped in my car, and got there in time for awards. Then I was standing on the side of the course for the men's start, and 2 minutes to the gun, Bill Miles walked over to me and asked what my excuse was. I told him I just woke up, my alarm didn't go off, and I hadn't warmed up, brought racing stuff, etc... He said, 'Sounds like a poor excuse, jump in!' Then Anders ran off the line and told me to 'learn how to not be a bitch' and that he brought extra flats. I said I couldn't, said it was a bad idea, and then said screw it. I sprinted to his warmups and tied on his flats (a half size too big?) threw off my shirt, my hat, and stepped on the line. I asked Anders and Josh how long the race was - two miles - and how I should run it. Anders said go out fast. So Literally one minute from putting on the shoes to the gun. No warmup. The gun went off and I went out pretty hard, maybe 72 through the quarter. I was in 8th-10th going into the woods, and around a mile 3 varsity kids went by. I didn't get passed up suicide hill, gave it what I had from 800 out, and finished 13th. Not bad, considering the circumstances. This was awful, and fun at the same time. I think I was 6th of Alumni? I ran 10:55 (course record prior to today was 10:18) and I'm not exactly fresh. I like to think with a proper warmup I could move up a bit, but I'll have another shot in two weeks. With my own shoes this time :) Marit was 3rd in her race, and Alayna won. Then Bill Miles sent me TWO Facebook messages. Pretty cool day :) cooled down 4ish with Anders and Jeremy Drenckhahn."

So, It wasn't super hot, but it was humid, and then it rained for the middle 14 miles. I was going to do the standard progression, but after a pretty drastic jump in the frequency of quality days this week, I thought just sustaining would be good enough if I didn't feel like racing at the end - and I suspected I wouldn't.

Ran most of this on the TC course (creek to the west river, north to franklin, across to east river, down to LSB, back to West River, and north to the greenway) and got a stark reminder that there is really nothing truly flat on that course. 

Felt comfortable for most of it, but by the last 2 or three I wasn't too happy anymore. Dehydrated, soaked, and my shoes were filled with water. I took a gel at mile 13, and that helped, but I still was pretty dizzy by the end. I felt mentally tired today. I had a great weekend, but I still felt sort of purposeless out there."

You can't do the same thing that hasn't worked the last 6 years and expect that it'll magically work for this crop of runners. Period. Is it going to take another decade of being 8th and 4th?

Then we got into med school, post college training, life, love, and the pursuit-of-we-aren't-sure-what.

But I backed off during it because I started to feel sick.

I was shooting for 3:55, because that's the number that was in my head without really thinking about it. Ended up running them all between 5:05 and 5:20 pace, and looking back - threshold pace being what you could reasonably sustain for 50-60 minutes, I should have run them all around the upper range of that.

Not sure where the 5:18 came from in the last rep, I just imagine it was in the turns and transitions of the north end of Calhoun. Got yelled at by some bikers, and encouraged by some others. After our last 5k, a guy who was running and pushing a disabled girl in an adapted wheelchair stopped and told us how inspiring we were. I told him the same- there are still some good people in this world. Merchant met us for the cool down, and that helped pass the miles. Good day, and I did what I wanted in the workout: felt good throughout, and pretty relaxed until the very end - and it didn't help that my shoes were filled with sweat, and this puts me over 107 miles in the last seven days.

After going to class tonight to find out that the graduate semester doesn't start until Wednesday, I came home with extra daylight out to run. 8 more to bring the 3 day total to 54. Loading up mileage this week because this week and next it's now or never, and there's an off chance that I might run John's half marathon with him this weekend. I can't decide if it'd be better to go into that tired and work for it, or back off a little. By front-loading, I can do either one and decide later in the week. Or I might not do it. We'll see. If I did do it, it'd be controlled - 5:35 to 5:40 through 10, then maybe, MAYBE peek and  find out how well the ol' carrot farming operation is going..

Woke up pretty early and didn't feel like running, so I laid in bed and read for a while. Even after I finally did get moving, I just stared out the window at the sidewalk for quite a while before finally getting out the door. Running is so empowering, and can also make you feel helpless sometimes.

After warming up a little, I actually didn't feel bad at all. My legs were sturdy, and not at all sore (granted I was running fairly relaxed). I think next fall I want to do shorter, faster races. I was pretty tired by the last few miles of this run, and you can chalk that up to marathon necessity, I suppose. Not that I'd even run less frequently if I were doing mile-10k's, but I would definitely not have to do 10 mile morning runs. I did reflect a bit on the trial-by-fire, all-in training that I've been doing for the majority of the last 4+ years, and someday I know I'm going to miss it.

09/07/2014,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,19.10,miles,7080,,,Kinvara 2,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran the CIty of Lakes half marathon today as a marathon-pace workout. Greeno and two others went out hard, then it was me and a few guys leading a huge peloton of folks that apparently didn't want to lead. The goal was to just run 5:35-5:40, pick it up at the end if I felt ok, and run 1:14.

At the mile (5:40) some guy got antsy and broke the little cocktail party we were having. Generally, this is no problem. But this guy moved HARD, was from lifetime fitness, and was wearing earbuds and an iPod. I didn't go with, because I wasn't racing (no small task. It was pretty difficult to let guys run away/not cover moves that I knew I could easily manage.) our second mile was 5:28 - but I told myself no faster than 5:30 before 10, so I eased up. By now it was Merchant and me, and we settled in. We ran side by side a bit, and he drafted off me for quite a while (hitting tangents, I suppose). We were fully conversational for the first ten miles. It felt good to have someone to talk to, and to be able to talk comfortably at sub 5:40 pace. Aerobically I felt really strong. My legs were tired by the end, but I think that has more to do with the training load than the pace of the day. I took powerade a few times, water once, had a Gu at 7, and another just before 10, but I didn't finish that one, because there was work to be done at that point. I got side aches from both Gu's. Sucky.

I had ONE goal during this race: To catch and beat the headphones guy from Lifetime. Spite, perhaps. By mile 9 I couldn't see him any more, and by 10 I figured he was 600m ahead, but coming back. Turning south on Calhoun (mile 10.5?) the last time, I looked at Merch and said, 'It's time to go get this guy.' So we picked it up, and right before WIlliam Berry, we had pulled him in. I backed off a tad at that point, because there was no one else in range, and I didn't feel like I had to race Ben. So he and I cruised in the last 4 or 5 hundred meters, and I finished a step behind him.

I was only looking for 1:14, ended up 1:12:59 and 6th place (I think)...

Really good crowd support - two specific categories of people: Circuit runners that weren't racing, and 20 something white girls with yoga pants clutching their Starbucks. No joke. Oh, and Little Kate :) 

I haven't seen results, but with the exception of Greeno, I feel like I could have run with anyone in the field had I raced. Legs were tired, and I felt like I could have held pace for 20, but not 26. Hopefully taper will make Summit bearable. 

Felt strong enough.

Really encouraging workout, and John and Anders killed it too. 14 mile reps between the three of us, and zero of them were over 5 minutes.

Also, since this is something of a diary to me, I forgot to mention this: last week when JL, Anders and I were doing our last mile repeat, this little blond boy (4 years old?) just comes tearing across the infield toward us, with his arms out, screaming 'I NEED TO HUG YOU!!!!!!!!!' His mom apologized and ran after him, scooped him up, and when we finished our rep, apologized to us, saying 'he's a hugger.' We laughed, put our trainer back on, and ran a cool down.

Knee was giving me some issues - it just dawned on me that I may need some new trainers. Last night I was fretting about the taper, and had an internal battle going over only doing 10 400's last night. The training workhorse in me wanted to just keep cranking until I couldn't, but I know the time for that has passed. Maybe that's what makes me nervous: that I can't do anything to get in better shape anymore, and the only thing of benefit that can be done is to rest. Unnerving. Anyway, I had a dream last night that I was running TC, went through the mile sub 5:20 and felt so good. But the course became less and less marked, and eventually I took a wrong turn and no one knew where I was supposed to go. I ran a 5:58, then saw a police office at an intersection on top of this huge hill, and I ran a 6:12 to get there, then he wouldn't let me cross the street because of traffic, so I had to stop and wait...

I felt ok doing strides before the start, and lined up having put it out of my mind. I wore shorts, and I wish I'd have had half tights, because my legs stayed cold for a long time. The field immediately broke into a lead pack of 10 or so, and a chase pack. I tucked in with the chasers, hit the mile in 5:37, and tried to go to sleep. After an uphill second mile in 5:41, the chase pack panicked, and dropped a 5:29 third mile. By this point, we were strung out, single file heading down lake of the isles. How does a marathon string out in three miles? I was surprised. mile four was a 5:33, then I think we finally settled in. Merch and I were alone by this point, the chase pack either strung out in front, or dissolved into the back masses. from there we went 5:35, 5:33, 5:35, 5:37, 5:38, 5:33... you get the point. We were sleeping. My legs were heavier than I'd hoped, and I knew it was going to be a grind, but it was still tolerable. We rolled through the half in 1:13:2x, and Merchant left me, hooking on to some guy who was running much faster than I wanted. The creek sucked, and it was too early for that. I remember coming into the falls and thinking, oh boy. There are still 11 miles left, and I'm starting to feel stiff. Then Marotz was out there and told me to quit feeling sorry for myself. He was right - In my head I said I needed to quit being a baby and do what I came here to do. And then I was back in it. This went off and on for the next 3 miles. Heading toward lake street, I felt something change. At first there was no pain, but my stride was getting shorter in my right leg. I tried to take longer steps, and then the pain came. It was like with each toe off, my muscle would return to slightly less of a relaxed state. Going under the bridge, I saw Marit, and I knew then that I wasn't going to make it. I felt like crying. I took my water bottle, drank some, and thought maybe I could get over Franklin and back to the other side. So I kept limping on, but somewhere north of the greenway, just short of 19, I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't lift my leg, I was running almost 7 minute pace. I stepped off the course, stopped my watch, and felt positively shattered. I started walking back toward lake street, knowing Mar would be at mile 20. People kept talking to me, offering help, condolences, talking about how strong I looked and this is the marathon and even to the strongest in the marathon These Things happen. When I saw Marit on the far side of the bridge, I lost my composure a bit. It was a matter of time, I suppose. I'm glad I wasn't alone.

I'm left with questions. 2012 felt so easy for nearly 20 miles. Even without my hamstring problem, I was going to fall apart. My legs didn't feel anything like last time. I wasn't floating. I'll take a few days off now, but I'm torn on where to go from here, as far as running. Part of me wants to chase my losses, put in two more hard months and run CIM in December. I could do it, I know I could. But even if it went well, would it outweigh the toll it'd take on my soul? Cold morning runs, probably treadmill workouts, late night runs after class in the dark? Or do I hang it up for 2014? Find contentment in the few good races I ran back in March and April and take the Summer and Fall as a casualty of putting all the eggs in one basket? I really want to run 10k and down next year - that was the plan, but I think that was subconsciously contingent on TC going well. Or do I give up spring track and run grandmas? Some of this is rhetorical, but I wouldn't mind input.

It's just hard, you know? And maybe this is dramatic, but hey, it's my log. And the marathon is... It's consuming. What's possibly most frightening is that I didn't even really feel that great. Maybe it was the cold, maybe my goals weren't realistic on that course? I don't like to doubt my training, but it makes me wonder if I actually know what I'm doing. Though it seems to work for everyone else. I don't like to be unresolved. That's a big part of why this is particularly challenging. 

I am exceptionally grateful for the support network I have, though. The number of people who came to the race to cheer, watch, or help me was incredible. And all the text messages/calls/emails after was humbling, too. I'm really thankful that even when things don't happen how they should, I have so many people that are proud anyway.

I walked in the door, opened a beer, sat on the couch, played some video games, took a nap, ate junk food (later a stuffed crust pizza) and all it made me feel was awful. Seriously, I don't know how people live like that. They must feel gross all the time.

Started with a sharp, pinching pain in my sciatic, which slowly wrapped around to the front of my hip though out the run. It was one of those pains that I think would stay at bay, mostly, but if I had to stop for any reason I wouldn't be able to restart.

Because I'm a jerk and Im'm looking for any way to get rewards for my summer training, I slow-rolled a dude today. Toward the end of the run, I was slowly gaining on a guy (he was probably running 7:05 pace, maybe 7's. When I got 20m away, he looked over his shoulder and his cadence increased. I didn't think anything of it, it was dark, and maybe my footsteps startled him. Then he did it again, and the cadence noticeably increased, again. I didn't even slow roll, really. I just went over the top, sub-6, and held it until I was out of sight. Substitute gratification does not vent completely the deeper yearnings, however, and it made me want to get on a track and race. In time. There is time, and time and time.

I hodge-podged 5 miles around the river, over to the dike, and back to the start line of Gobble Gait. I ran the 8k course doing 4 minutes on at thresholdy-ish pace, 1 minute jogging recovery for the whole thing. I think I was like 5:0x-5:20 for most of it, but I know I was over 5:40's for the half mile hike up CP Adams hill. Ended up hitting the finish in 28:10.

Predicted was something like 14 inches, and through it was still snowing when I ran, there was maybe 3 on the ground accumulated. Surprisingly, I wasn't even mad about it. Crossing slippery roads sucked, but where the snow was untouched it was fine. I only have 2 weeks left of needing to be 'serious' about running, unless I feel like racing indoor (that just depends where my heart is at in December), and the whole run I just pictured early, dark evenings in front of wood stoves or sitting on radiators while wet clothing dried next to it, feeling limbs slowly warming back up, and complete exhaustion after a long workout that is only trumped by the starving hunger waiting for gorgonzola pasta to finish cooking. Long skis with friends through the woods, or under the lights at French, endless quiet laps at Hyland... I feel happy."

That said, I went to the hamster wheel and approximately 2 or 2 and a half minutes into my run I was bored. I quickly went through my rolodex of workout thoughts - generally I do 2 up, 2 down, with 15/10/5 in the middle and it always comes out to be 10.5 miles. That seemed too long, so I just did 2 up, 2 down, and a relaxed 5 mile tempo/progression in the middle. Went 5:42, 5:3x, 5:24, 5:18, 5:00 for a 27:01 5 mile. Some curly-haired guy got on the treadmill next to me and started to match my paces in the second mile of my warmup, and due to sheer boredom I decided to play a little game. He'd match my pace, and then go one click faster, so I'd let him for a bit, and then click it 2 times, let him go back past, and then when I went down to 5:42 pace, he tried, and I've never seen running form fall apart so fast. That must be what it'd look like if I tried to run with Finan. I mean, this guy made it at that pace for a minute or two, but he was literally throwing his legs out in front of him. It looked really painful.

Then I kept picking it up, he backed off and at some point near the end of my tempo, he  stopped running. I'm sure that makes me a jerk, but so do a million other things, and I needed something to distract myself.

I lifted and did core as long as I was there, and remembered how hard lifting is. Onward and upward."

That and spending $2500 to go to New Zealand to meet with a girl he had a connection with, only to find out that... not so much.

'Another godawful eight miles in the books.

The questions recur, or at least they should. They are old ones that we chew on, the cud of experience. What the hell is this all about, this onwards, this forwards, this march to who knows where? 

I barely got out the door after a day at work chasing my tail around. There are always good reasons, rational reasons, hella good arguments for just staying put. Like: I ran too hard last week and my legs are tired. Like: The grass really needs to be mowed. Like: Isn't this supposed to be fun? Like: What's another eight miles in the grand scheme of things?

When you carve a life up into the little bits that we actually feel and see, it's hard to figure the meaning. Only rarely does a vision appear of how the whole fits together. Most of the time it's just keep your head down and trust that it will all work out. The other option is to drive yourself crazy with questions, and there's even less point to that. The best argument for God's existence: there must be a higher power because I sure as hell don't know much.

After about 10 too many minutes of indulging these sorts of thoughts, you realize that shit if you are gonna sit around and wonder about the meaning of life, you might as well be getting those eight miles in. So, you head to the door not expecting much at all but at least you've got your shoes on now and turns out it's not even raining.

Down the front steps and you begin a sideways trot. The familiar sequence: the stiff achilles, the stumbling gait for the first mile. Up the first hill still not warmed up. Onwards you go, through the quiet city, past the strolling couples and the goofy dogs. There's even a pink sunset. The stiffness dissipates and the stumble gathers itself into something like a flow, the mind clears, and you've got something approximating authentic experience. 

And even if it's not, at least it's another godawful eight miles in the books.'

No idea why that part didn't get plowed.

Overall it felt good, but the first 2+ miles my hips and hamstrings didn't know what was going on. 

Also, not that I'm even close to a suit and tie guy, but running from work is always awkward. Any fraction of professional reverence dissolves when your employees see you in spandex tights."

I shuffled my entire iPod, and gosh... that resulted in a pretty interesting mix of songs. But it was good. The ski felt really controlled, I felt smooth and like I had fairly good balance. Somewhere around the middle I crashed head-on into a 10-12 year old boy. By Jan's place, he was skiing towards me on the wrong side of the trail (lots of people going the wrong way tonight). I went right to avoid him, but he went the same way. I cut back left, but so did he. Then we must have both thought to ditch to the tracks, and we collided. Fortunately for me, 150lbs vs 80lbs means I won that battle. No one was hurt though.

I started off really relaxed and got a little faster each lap until my last one where I just sort of dawdled. My 9th 5k was 14:00, which I'm happy with because at no point did I feel like I was skiing hard. By that time, the snow had become a bit icy, which I'm sure sped things up.

I didn't fall, but I was close more than once. I ended up 17th in 25:03. I got out fairly slow, and it felt really conservative. I don't mind that approach, in fact I probably prefer it, but I don't like being stuck behind people. So it took 2k or so to shake free of the congestion, but then things went pretty well. I ended up skiing in a pack with Hans, Corey Brinkema, Spencer Davis and Drew Holbrook. We traded spots a few times, but on the last time up the long climb by the tubing hill I went past all of them, and got about a 15m lead - I don't think I was ever passed on a gradual climb today. Then on the downhill above the par 3 lot, they stuck it to me. Old man Brinkema climbed to fast - his feet looked positively frantic, and he beat me by 11 seconds. Oh well. It was a good learning experience, and it felt awesome to make myself hurt a bit again. I don't think that competitive fire will ever go away. Technique definitely held me back in the later stages, I couldn't V2 at all once my legs went to rubber. I still tried, but I cringe thinking about how it must have looked. Really happy about racing today, in retrospect.

Jed, Mar, and Small Anders were out cheering for me, which was cool :) 
I apparently beat some reasonably fast guys, and i'm really getting excited for the Birkie now. I still need a bit of training, but that'll come.

Story of the day: A middle aged guy in a yellow jacket started next to me in the mass start, and said 'good luck' to me. I said thanks, and wished him luck too. He said something about luck not mattering because he's already over 1000km for the year in training, which isn't actually that much. And he had a drink belt on (remember this is 10k), which he drank from around 8k.

And he beat me.

I Had no expectations, really, for this race - less a few quiet thoughts that I kept to myself based on past year's results. Got to the race 10 minutes to the start, which turned out to be more than enough time, actually. Looking at the competition, I felt like starting in the second row was reasonable. Turns out I was right next to Nicolette Reker, who won it for the women last year. We started, and what a cluster. Sure I'm not great at double polling, but it was like everyone in the field thought they could win it. Within a kilometer, I bet I was in 300th place (including the 26k skiers who started with us). That was fine, until we got off the lake, and the trail narrowed down, and I had to get around people who clearly were not going to hold their initial pace. It wasn't until just after 8k that I felt like I could start skiing my own race. The majority of the race was: Sit with a pack for 500m before feeling antsy, spend the next 4ish km trying to catch up to the next group, repeat. The majority of the time, I was skiing alone, and couldn't see anyone ahead of me. From 14k-22k, I was completely alone, and I must have eased up, because around 22 I looked back to see this huge conga line sashaying their way toward me. I caught one solo guy and told him the peloton was coming, and he said 'Good, we'll have people to ski with soon then'. So I hit the gas, left him, took my only gel, and got across OO, putting space between myself and the parade behind me. I spotted a group with some Johnnies, 2 LNR guys, and a few others that were moving pretty quickly, and I thought they'd be a good group to race with. right around then, my gel kicked in and I felt fresh and like I had boundless energy. I think I spent the first 25k waiting to actually race, so when it finally got to be within 15k of the finish I was getting excited. I caught the group, and started moving up a few spots on each climb. I finally decided to set off on my own again, caught one more guy, and when I saw 32k on my watch, I started to hammer. I felt so fast. My technique probably was poor, but my cadence was remarkable. There weren't many people left to catch, so I started to make a game of catching the classic skiers. With maybe 4k to go (I'd spent 3k trying to reel in Drew Holbrook, and closed the gap to maybe 25-20m) and I just randomly fell on an uphill. No reason, I just fell. I lost probably 10 seconds in the snow, a few more getting up to speed, but what I really lost was my contact with Drew, and I no longer had time to catch him. I caught 2 more guys in the last Km, but im the final 20m, one of the guys came roaring back past me, and V2ing as hard as I could, I couldn't sneak back past him. He was the only person who passed me for the entire race.

I finished 29th overall, 4th in my age group.

I'm happy with this race, and it was really fun. I love the excitement of getting to the late stages of a race, and knowing that I've got more left, that I'm stronger than the people around me. I felt like I got stronger as the race went on, and the feeling of pushing yourself as hard as you can is awesome. 2 weeks until the race is bigger, more competitive, I start farther back, and it's 9km longer, but I'm up for it.

I learned a lot today. I need to figure out how to get out a little quicker, simply for the sake of space. I also learned that the hardest part is biding my time before I can start hammering. The first 25k felt like a really awful formality I had to get through in order to race.

Onward and upward. Skiing is alright, I guess :)"

Against my better judgement, I decided to ski from there to Hayward with Steve, but had to sprint north another almost 2k to catch Jill/Anders and let them know to not wait for me. Then back to OO, and off to Hayward with Steve. Talked a lot about everything under the sun, so it went pretty quickly. My body was tired, but I still felt alright. Coming across the lake for the last k was less than enjoyable, but I'm going to need to be used to that. Longer than I was expecting, but I can't let Steve get in extra training without me."

My arms don't feel super strong, and they'll need to be in a week and a half. Today after the ski I did a within-groups linear regression analysis of the last 5 years of the Birkie results, as they related to finishes in the Pre-Birkie. The regression itself predicted I'd finish 212th for men (the top 200 make the next year's elite wave). Adding in a control to the equation (y=4.9117x+69.926 if any men wanted to predict their finish) for competitive variance between fields, it suggests a finish of 208th (turns out this year's pre birkie was quite a bit more competitive than 'average'). The plus side: The margin of error to remain within a high (85%) confidence interval is high, and allows plausibility of a <200 finish.='' the='' down='' side:='' wave='' 2.='' i'm='' going='' to='' have='' to='' not='' get='' trapped='' at='' the=''></200>

*I will say that in figuring out the control for competitive variance, there was an outlier in the data points, ~50% higher than the others. If that single point is omitted, and the control (a percentage of time back from the winning time) is figured without it, it suggests a 193rd place finish. But that's falsifying data ;)"

It was first on a trail, then the second half was this old logging road - it was sunny and 46 (which is my favorite running temp - shorts and a long sleeve) - but in the forest the trees were so dense that it wasn't that bright. The ground was dry, but everything felt damp, and quiet and like the woods just enveloped us. Had a good chat with Dustin about Oregon life, coaching, how crazy AlSal is, life, love, and happiness. He said he misses things about minnesota, but how he quickly forgets them on runs like this one. It's easy to get lost, figuratively, out there. It was really good to banter with him again, and talk about how only a handful of our generation from the MIAC are still chasing the dream. Such a nice guy. I wish he was closer.

After the run, He, Gina, and myself hung out in the parking lot and talked a bit more - the healthcare system in Portland, and how inadequate in number mental health clinics are.

Then I drove downtown, parked, walked to VooDoo Donuts, ate two massive ones, talked to some dude named Cole (likely was drunk) for 20 minutes about the Taxi industry, and headed off to the airport!

So I hesitated, and said, 'John, are you in there?' No answer. so I knocked. no answer. So I opened the door, and what do you know? Scully is sitting on the toilet with his pants down and headphones in. After staring at each other for several seconds I walked away, and he come out and said, 'Honestly, I was done like 15 minutes ago.' ...So he must have had a good playlist.

I realize I'm pouty and pissy and I should just deal with it but I'm so frustrated. SIX MONTHS. There's no reason anything should be hurting. I was at work today for 10 hours and I still couldn't do the things I needed to or please people, my boss keep pressing unrealistic deadlines that I can't meet because my portion is contingent on other people getting stuff done and they keep pushing it off, and all I wanted to do today was come home a run a few goddamn miles to clear my head. I got to the rose garden and literally just yelled. I couldn't run anymore. So I walked home. I want to scream, I kind of want to cry, I want... something to blame, but there is nothing. Sometimes crap like this just happens, I guess, and I feel hopeless. I don't think Lezon can help me, and I don't know who or what else could. I'm tired. I'm just tired of failing. I don't know when I'll run again."

I was tired when I went to do this, kinda pissy when I started, but while I was out there I felt thankful to just be on my feet and breathing a little harder. Just myself and my thoughts today. 10 minute run after, barefoot, no noticeable pain. Strength and rolling in the parking lot after, I was the last car there. Beautiful night.

Really missing running right now. I don't want to be the guy who talks about when he 'used to.blah blah blah' just yet."

Planned another 20 minute run today, but work ran right up to class, and class is going until 10 or 10:30 or something. Not looking good. Also, today I saw Folske and while he tells me about his patients every time, we reached a new level of hipaa violation today: halfway through my treatment, Kelly Mortenson just walked into the room I was in with Folske because he 'thought he heard my voice', and we just started talking about why we both were there. Obviously I don't care, just thought it was.... Interesting.

At this rate, I'm thinking I should join the Wayzata Ski Club this summer and just try to win the Birkie next year.

Absolutely gorgeous out this morning, wish I was running, but really happy to be at it one way or another."

It's going to be a bit of a road back if/when I ever can run again."

The first quarter was maybe HM effort, then 5k, then letting loose a bit (not kicking). Split 4:54 in trainers, so I can't not be happy with that. Even though I felt sloppy as heck and it was aerobically challenging."

Started out ok, a little sore from .5 miles to the 1 mile, then it cleared up (still didn't feel normal, but there was no pain) and my form felt good, so I just went with it.

6:44, 6:10, 6:07, 6:08, 5:55. 5:45, 5:42, then a half mile at 7:22 pace back to the house after bumping into John.

This was promising, informative, and a harsh bit of truth. Being honest with myself, I'd guess (based on today) that my current HM pace is right around 5:45. So I have a long ways to go to be in shape again. That said, I'll finish off this week with some modicum of caution, and then I have 4.5 weeks to fitness and a 3 day taper. Let's see what happens, I guess :)"

But I decided I'd try it one more time, and if it hurt I'd come home, call Bud, and get an order for an MRI. ended up running essentially painlessly the whole way. Even did 2 of John's mile repeats with him in 5:01, 5:00 out on the Kenilworth Corridor. They didn't feel 'hard' per say, the first one was actually quite enjoyable, but my lungs feel really small. That became challenging during the second half of the second interval. Legs are alright, though. Cooled down home. Really confused by this run, but I'm not in a position to complain."
