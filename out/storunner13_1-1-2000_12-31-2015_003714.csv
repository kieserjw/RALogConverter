Then, 9 miles, 58:30, turn around....do 3 more?  Or do the whole 9 miles out, 9 miles back?  DO IT TO IT.

Start cranking them out, little-to-no fatigue.  Left foot/ankle/calf/leg sort of tensed/cramped up, but I ignored it, it faded after 3 miles.  Things started getting (a little) tough at 15 miles...still cranking out 6:10ishs.

Finished the out and back in 1:54:27...6:30s out with the wind for a generous 9, 6:13s back against it, with rain.  Not bad.  Cooled down with an easy 2 miles.  Could have maintained for probably another 30-45 minutes easily.

Set out for a long run....planned to do 19, heading down to the Minnehaha Pkwy paths via Calhoun and Harriet.  Felt good....strongish wind for the first 5 miles, but not bad..it became a more gentle breeze by the time I was headed East.

Finally hit my stride around 7 miles...probably around 6:35-6:30s, feeling good, but not tooo good, so I held back when my legs naturally tried to pick it up.

Once I hit the River Pkwy, it was go time.  I started picking it up more and more felt good, then great, and then the shirt came off (I was heating up)...I was hoping I wouldn't hit the wall when I got to the Greenway.

I didn't.  Turned onto the Greenway and started breaking it down.  My leg (Sartorius) stiffened up for a mile, but it disappeared.  If there was a biker that wasn't wearing spandex, I passed them.  I got a honk from Mark Forsberg as I passed under Hiawatha Ave, since the bridge is closed.  I finished the last 3 miles in 16:30, the last mile in a little under 5:30.  SOLID SOLID SOLID.

I ran 19 miles in 1:57:31, averaging 6:11 per mile.  I definitely finished the last 10 in under an hour...probably faster than 5:50 pace.

All that said, I did put forth some effort over the last 4 miles...it felt pretty relaxed, and the last mile was a breeze.  My stride lengthened and got really smooth, despite some lactic in my upper body.  ....I should really sign up for a race..

I decided at that point that I should PROBABLY cool down for a little bit.  So I made it an even 20, with a shakeout mile."

The 1' intervals all rolled along really well, and the last 2 were super fast.  I felt really good despite 20 on Saturday and a double yesterday.

Back tracking, I covered about 8.5 miles for the workout, 2.5 of which was rest in between.  30 minutes for about 6 miles, probably just a little under.

EDIT:

I covered more like 8.25 miles... but the rest (17') was likely slower than 7' pace... Even at 2.5 miles of rest I was 5:12 / mile."

Waxed with SkiGo 380 powder wax, SkiGo C110 fluoro powder. Skis were NOT fast, but not slow compared to others. Got a little pick up on downhills and seemed to be a little faster than others there too. Kick wax was Rex ProGrip Green covered with Swix VR30. Kick was sticky. Anders and I got a final coat of Toko X-Cold at the start which helped for the first 10-15k. The tracks were mostly snow-filled. The group did not want to break trail in the tracks--a lot of skiing outside the tracks making stability and having good form tough, especially for me. The hills were brutally slow and the leaders of the chase pack seemed to slow-herringbone the hills (tactically). I moved to the front of the chase pack (2 others far ahead) and pulled for 2k or so somewhere between 10-20k...I should not have made this effort, ended up falling back after a ways. Slowed down, focused on technique and recovered. Started gaining ground after the half-way point, and felt better. My kick was still icing up and I had to kick it off every time I went up a hill / skied outside the tracks. Moved up well from the 35-40k--after being 15th at the half-way point. Passed Anders and two others with 5k to go and put a little gap--but no tracks and rough uneven terrain slowed me down and they caught up. The two others passed me with 1k to go (whiteout conditions near the dome) and I had a pretty good finish.

Overall, a GREAT race, but I can race better/smarter/harder next time I think. 10th place finish was a surprise and a treat! What a great race.

I overtook Pojke on the hills a couple times, but he was unfazed. He pooped with 2k to go--which was my fault for not taking him for a longer walk in the morning--to make sure he pooped twice. The last 2k were tough as Pojke tired, but he gained some energy to over-take a 2 dog team. The slow flat conditions near the stadium were tough but we finished strong.

3+ mile warm up. 7 miles around Cedar Lake at 5:35-5:30 pace...unfortunately I did not hit the SPLIT button when starting the tempo, so I don't have the first lap time.  5x 30' strides/finishing sprints.  5 mile cooldown.

Almanzo 100 mile gravel bike race in Southern MN.  Felt pretty chipper for the first 30 miles.  Started to slow after that.  Bike was performing flawlessly.  Some farmers tried to stop us from taking a road due to doing their ammonia fertilizer treatment...but we kept going.

At around 40 or 50 miles in, I started to falter, and my breathing became more and more shallow--perhaps a reaction to all the dust?  Or the short bout of breathing in some ammonia?  I'm not sure, but it was a sufferfest after that.  Luckily, I had Anders' wheel to follow ahead of me, or the race would have been much longer.

Some clutch food / water stops at 70 miles, and later at around 80 miles.  Thanks to Banjo Brothers for Nutter Butters and Coke.  Damn that was good.

Breathing got worse all the way to the end...it took a good 30 minutes to get to a point where I was no longer anxious and another hour to get back to near normal.  Anders brought me some Brompheniramine which may have helped...not sure.

I will definitely do this race again, but I will definitely need to do more riding before."

Miss and Out was really good.  Finished 6th.  Had to put in big efforts multiple times to get around for the last 5 or 6 eliminations, and ended up being a little passive for the lap I was out.  Next time, I'll look to get an inside front lane, or sprint ahead so that those in the best spots can't just sit pretty for 40 laps.

Started out in the morning during a light drizzle (the main storm had already passed).  The first miles were a bit slow--warming up the legs.  Quickly found my stride and felt good.  Headed toward Minnehaha PKWY trail for the typical 19 mi. long loop.  Sometime around 8-10 miles in I started feeling a pain in the front of my lower right leg (about 4-6 inches up from my ankle).  I grew more and more nervous as the run went on the and the pain continued to get worse (which I perceived to be muscular--since the pain intensified as I picked up my foot).  I stopped briefly twice to see if I could quickly stretch out the pain ('knot'?) but to no avail.  The last 2 or 3 miles probably could have been faster--as I was feeling good--but the pain prevented me from really locking it down.  I slowed down after 17 miles and then walked the last half mile.  The pain continued in force for the next 2-3 hours, but then diminished in the afternoon.  No pain the next day.  Very strange--I was worried about a stress fracture...less so now.

Felt very comfortable through the first mile and a half of the 3 mile interval, and controlled over the last half.  The next interval was scheduled to be 2 miles, but foot fatigue (or rather...wrong shoes?  I hate the piranhas) kept me tight, not smooth, and slowing. The next mile interval was very tough, and the last half interval was more anaerobic than I expected and dipping a ways into the well.

Unfortunately, this workout is not giving me confidence.  Or I just need a partner for anything over a mile.  I need to reconsider 68:00 and think more about running just 69:xx.  And I need to get those new shoes.

Despite my lack of confidence a week out, I pulled things together the last few days before the race and got my head in the right place.  I was confident that I could hit 5:15 miles, no problem.  Felt great when I woke up, and once I got to the course my legs were ready to rock.

48F and misting the whole time.  Great for the start.  Nick Ross and I got out at 5:18 pace for the first 4 miles...which was slower than I wanted, but I felt very relaxed and was able to just roll with our group.  After about 5 miles the group faltered a little so I moved to the front and pushed ahead a little.  I didn't really look back for 2 miles, but it turned out I had gapped them.

Ran by myself for the rest of the race.  I should have latched on to a TCTC runner as he went by, but I lost focus for just long enough that he had gapped me as well.  Still felt strong as I came into town.  Rolled down the brick-covered Superior Street without any issues.  But again, as in 2012, the turns in the last mile really took their toll.  Mental fatigue had set in and it was tough to navigate all the twists and turns.  Ended up getting passed by 4 runners near the finish, but still came through strong.

I was quite chilled over the last couple miles.  I may not have had enough to eat the day before...but my energy stores were fine for running.  Luckily I got my clothes on fairly quickly and cooled down with John Leaf...the last half mile I slowed to near 10 minute pace..my energy had completely depleted.  Loaded up on snacks and went back to the hotel to get a shower.

All-in-all, a great effort.  Unfortunately, a slower start and racing alone made it tough to meet a goal of 68:XX.  I only felt like I was really going to the well over the last 1.5 miles, and that was mostly from mental fatigue, my legs were still working fine.  It give me a lot of confidence for the next long race I have."

I was inspired to write a silly poem:

It's going to rain--

06:27

Moving
over the asphalt.
Shoes taking the lead
one after the other.

Sliding
in from the West,
the wind storms in--
cool, soft.

06:22

Churning
wind through the leaves--
water on the lake.
--as it flow around my feet.

Flowing
through the streets.
Feet hard on the path
feel the water
over and between my toes.

6:13

Pounding
in my chest
and onto my head.
Onto my arms
onto the pavement.

Gushing
in my arteries
in the gutter
into the storm drain

5:59

Rolling
down my face,
over my lips,
into my mouth.
Each movement is smooth--
sliding, frictionless

Dancing
in the pools,
each step
in between the drops.

5:47

It's going to rain--
I'm going to run."

I guess I AM an ass for ignoring the road closed signs and slipping by the construction (on the un-blocked) path...but I have no regrets.

Finally got into the swing of things and dropped some miles around 6:30 pace--nice and easy.  Pojke had a blast, and enjoyed stopping twice to drink some water and cool off his belly.  His paws were sore the next day though...too much pounding or hot pavement. :(

10 lap scratch.  I didn't catch the jump and coasted in oh well.

Supersprint M+O.  Easy riding through the first 10 eliminations.  Then the 10 lap scratch.  Somehow second wheel was a good position going into the sprint.  The lead rider led out the sprint (no one went around above).  I just hugged his wheel as best I could.  Ended up getting passed by Peter on the home stretch, but still managed third!  47x14 was a good change.

40 lap points.  Great.  Unfortunately missed the first sprint, but there was a crew of 4 of us just breaking away for the next three sprints.  Had some very solid efforts for the next 3 sprints and finished 3rd overall.  BOOM.

50 lap JOKER'S GAMBLE points.  Good.  Bob let me jump in the Cat 3 points race at the end.  Points to the winner equaling whatever was pulled from a giant deck of cards.

Warmed up with Tim Lillehaugen at the start--did about 18 minutes, then added on a good number of strides and shakeout stuffs.  37F, no wind.  Half tights, singlet, arm sleeves, perfect.

The race went out REALLY fast, but then tapered down to a just fast pace after 200m of getting it out of our systems.  Settled in the with chase group and relaxed through the first 4 miles.  Stepped off a bit on the uphills and let fly a little on the downhills--which worked out well I think.  Everything went way better than I expected.  I rolled through the hills really well on River Road and had plenty of energy going up Summit.  I felt smooth, and strong throughout, and really only faltered when I didn't have someone to run with after the halfway point.  I should have toughened up for a mile and stuck with the group.  It turns out the race was .14 miles short--due to the lead police vehicle not making a proper turn.  Oh well--52:05 would be 52:49ish--which is still A OK by me.

I fell in the first 200m--which was dumb. Just caught an edge and tipped over. Made up the ground pretty quickly--my skis were feeling pretty darn fast. Didn't quite make it to the front group who finished 2-3 minutes ahead of me. Part of me thinks I could have hung on to them, but I'm not sure.

Felt good through 7.5k, but my last lap was certainly sloppy. I should have just tucked in behind someone in the chase pack and drafted until the final hill....but I'm not smart at racing skiing 10ks. Oh well.

Skis slowed by the end too--I guess I need to get better at corking fluoro applications.

I'm glad it was a shorter race, and maybe this is a good learning lesson for future races. Take more gels--don't pass when it's narrow. I think my training will pay off eventually...just not right now.

KR50 was good, VR55 was just as good, but a little less sticky. Covered with Start FHF40, both were still good, but VR55 was just a little better. Testing the skis was our warmup, but occurred a little too far away from the race start to be effective. I guess corking in the kick wax was our warm up. Barely made it to the line, and was 4 people back from the start. We need to remember to put some test/warmup skis in the tracks well before the start.

Anders was with the lead pack from the start, I struggled to get a good start and the pack disappeared, never to be seen again.

The first 12k was rough--striding was not working well for me, and having no one to follow was not making it easier. The next 12k was even worse, with some fresh snow, my skis were icing, and I was running up most of the hills, feeling sorry for myself.

Finally started feeling just OK after the halfway point and some nice long downhills, but still had no one to ski with. The third quarter was skied out of the tracks the whole time--since the tracks were slow and no one wanted to be the first to ski in them.

FINALLY felt good during the last 5k or so, after some icy hills, and dirty sections of the course. Double poling felt strong...but it was too late to make much of a difference.

Saw Anders 50m ahead of me just as we entered the stadium. I guess the race turned out OK, but I'm frustrated by the fact that I never really felt good throughout the whole race.

Tough waxing conditions, but no one was going to nail kick wax for the whole race, considering the falling snow, and micro-climates everywhere. I need to work on my striding more in the early season to be ready for this race next year."

Over the last km, I started to put in a finishing sprint effort, and Pojke caught on, pulling hard!  We took a sick inside line around the 180 corner with 500m to go and started to pull ahead.  Neck and neck on the 200m homestraight--we were staring to pull ahead a little.  Then Lexi started heading left to lap again, so Pojke and I had our break and won!

The first 8k went by easily, and I was in a good pack.  I was skiing by myself for the next 8k--keeping up only 40m behind the next group.  Finally caught up and skied with Anders and others for a while.  Gels were taken at good moments--got water quickly and easily.  However, come 14k to go, when I was hoping to make some efforts to increase the pace, the energy wasn't there.  10k to go, Anders and others broke away.  I had a clutch 1/2 bottle of gatorade with 6k to go, but it wasn't enough to wake me from the dead.  Got pulled 2/3rds of the way across the lake, but didn't have much to give a hard effort for the final kilometer.

All in all, a good effort, but definitely felt like I was lacking something.  Lack of energy seemed to be holding me back--and it seemed to be partially my CV.  My strength was there, and fatigue was not setting in, I just didn't have gas in the tank.  I'm pleased to finish higher than last year, but I think I can do better."

Classic race went out in a pack of ~10.  Stayed together until the last 5k or so of the first lap.  My skis were actually pretty fast, but I started getting fatigued and the top field gapped me (and Anders).  We caught one guy, but that was it.  My technique was still very good, but slowing skis did not help in the last bit.

Transition went pretty good.  I was a little out of it, and didn't have my skate skis in a good position to slide in next to them.  Didn't lose much time though.  Good.

Skate was a little rough at the start, and slow skis made it even tougher.  It seemed that despite having a good ski for the conditions, the wax just made climbing terrible.  I couldn't and didn't catch anyone, and just barely didn't let anyone catch me.  My technique was good through the first 15k, but I was just about beat for the last 10k.  Skiing around lots of other racers made it tough too.  It was a good effort, but the slow conditions tired me early.

It was a good race, and since the two 20-24ers were in the top four, I won a wooden ski!"
