The run was pretty uneventful, i just felt really sluggish compared to the past 2 days. We went up a big hill at like 9.5 miles and carl kinda gapped us, for some reason i got really pissed off and just took off after him and blew by him. At first the pace wasnt too hard, probably like 5:40 or so. But i kept picking it up hoping to drop him, i think he sensed my anger so he threw in a surge. I was content to stay stride for stride with him until about a mile to go where i threw in a huge surge that should never be allowed outside of a race. It was ridiculous, i felt like we were sprinting for awhile, the last mile definitely was near or maybe even a little under 5. Afterwards we both kinda just started stretching like nothing ever happened. So yeah, my legs are a little on the tired side right now, and my cough isnt quite gone yet...but i got until tuesdays workout to get better"

Junior year running overview:
-0 for 13 goals accomplished (ouch!), 3 in xc, 5 in indoor and outdoor
-3 pr's set (8k xc, outdoor 10k and 5k)
-3 race wins (Griak, Pre-Nats, Last Chance 5k)
-1 DNF (San Diego 1500...1st DNF ever)
-1 DFL (Howard wood 1500...1st DFL ever)
-1 non-intended day off (in february when i got food poisoning)

The good thing is that next year can only get better (knock on wood). Had a couple highs, lots of lows, and some really low-lows. I'm excited to move on and get into the summer miles. The main thing that ive learned from this year is to keep my running in perspective and to remember not to get too high or too low about anything in my running such as a bad race or a great workout. I have already resolved with myself that next year will be a better year, even if things dont go as planned in my running."

At about mile 6 i realized it was probably stupid to do a 13 mile route with no water. Finally at about 10.5 i layed down in the shade of a tree for like 5 minutes. The last 2.5 was a death march. I definitely was humbled by the heat today...i usually dont weigh after runs but i did today, and i was 134.4, 3 lbs less than i should be.

Season grade: B+/A-
At the beginning of the season our coach has us write down our goals. After not reaching any of my goals last year i decided to just write 'have fun everyday, work hard, and enjoy the season as much as possible.' i made it very important to meet all these goals, which i did, so im pretty happy about that...i did make goals for myself that i kept private. they were: have an undefeated season (which includes winning nationals, and to break 24 minutes. both of these goals weren't met, but im gonna blame it on my inability to set good goals. if i woulda known at the beginning of the season that i'd win conference, regions, and get top 10 at nats i'd be stoked. every race went about perfect except griak and nationals. griak i just didn't feel good, and nationals i don't know if i ran the smartest race i could have. overall though, this is the most happy i've been with a season in my college career.

winter training plan:
11/23-11/29: off
11/30-12/6: 70
12/7-12/13: 90
12/14-12/20: 100

i got to bed at 1am last night but woke up this morning at 8 just stoked for this run. so i had a small breakfast and hydrated, then ended up starting at 10am. I measured out the first mile to make sure my pace was good. i was really pumped starting out (idk why?) so i kept telling myself to relax and came through the mile in 6:05, a little quick. i ended up running straight east to the mississippi then crossing over and running pretty much right to downtown minneapolis. i got mixed up on where the 11 mile was, so i went out a little farther to make sure i did reach it. on the way back i felt great til about 15 when i hit a big hill that lasted forever because i was going away from the river. i still felt pretty good until about 19 when my right hamstring started getting a little wobbly. overall, it was nothing major. i ended up feeling pretty solid the last mile and closed in a 6:13. i remeasured it and found that i went 11.2 out, so 22.4 total. so i adjusted my times, and i was out in 1:09:10 and back in 1:09:26, which makes sense because there was a lot of uphill on the way back. definitely happy about this run. the easiness of it makes me stoked to run a marathon next fall! if i keep this trend up i will have to run 23 miles at 6:07 pace next year...yikes


EDIT: This is Brian Anderson, OFFICIALLY editing Greeno's log to portray an accurate run.  You see, Dan has a sick OCD disorder to NEVER log 1/2 miles.

First 3 miles- flat and through some neighborhoods so there was no wind. felt pretty effortless.

miles 4,5- fairly flat but they were both head on into the wind so it was a little harder than i would have liked.

miles 6,7- out of the wind with a couple of downhills. rolled pretty good to put some time in the bank for the next 2 miles.

miles 8,9- by far the toughest miles. there are 3 total uphills in these 2 miles

mile 10- nice and flat. picked it up a little to break 52:30...previous PR on the course was 54:33.

The original plan was to run both in sub 20, but after doing my warm up on parts of the course i realized that this goal wouldn't be too realistic. the majority of the route is on a bike path which is plowed but not salted at all, so there is ice on a lot of it and a thin layer of snow on almost all of it. after the warm up i decided i would just run the first one at a nice, hard effort, then try to run the second one faster.

the first one felt ok the first 2 miles, but then the ice got really bad for miles 3 and 4. the effort felt insanely hard for only averaging 5:10's. i almost fell 3-4 times, and i really felt like i was straining my hip flexor from slipping around so much. i was pretty pissed after the first one. on the second one i tried a different strategy: hammer the spots with good footing and relax on the ice. this strategy seemed to work because i ran 17 secs faster and felt a little more relaxed, and also wasn't nearly as close to falling as i was on the first one. after evaluating my effort and the ice, i believe i would have run 30-40 secs faster with good footing...but that is all speculation and doesn't really matter i guess. overall, not a bad workout, but im thinking i might end up doing all the rest of my workouts on either a treadmill or an indoor track.

Did this at Bethel after work. After my warm up i realized that i had only brought one racing flat shoe and left the other at home. i was super pissed, almost to the point of scrapping the whole workout. so my mindset was pretty bad heading into this one but i got it in, although it wasn't nearly the confidence booster that i hoped it would be. everything felt very uncomfortable except for the last 1600 which was only a little faster than goal half pace. I figure the heavy trainers added about .5 seconds per 200, so 1 second for the 4's, and about 4 seconds for the 16's...but that's just a rough guess."

We looped Cedar lake and lake of the isles. although my legs didn't feel the best it was still a great run. really wet on the paths so that kinda sucked but it was kinda fun trying to dodge them."
02/17/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,7.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"First run from the new apartment! didn't feel too hot this morning, probably cuz i slept terrible. i moved some of my stuff down yesterday but i only brought cool stuff (food, running stuff, entertainment) and no essential type stuff (toilet paper, bed, pillow, blankets), so i ended up sleeping on floor using some tshirts as a pillow with no blankets. anyway, for the run i ran to como lake and looped it 3 times and then ran back. im only about 1 mile from that lake so im pretty excied, although not too much so since it's only probably 1.6-1.7 miles around."

02/18/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Solo 6 in st michael. legs felt decent. the only downside about warm weather is that it makes the cold weather feel 10x worse. it was 15 degrees during the run, but there were 20-30 mph winds so it felt like below zero which really sucks because i started getting used to the 30s and 40s."

I ran down como ave over to downtown st paul by the capitol, then i hopped onto summit and took that to lexington and then took lex back to my place. added on a little around como lake at the end to get 14. i love my apartment's location so far. i can pretty much hit up every twin cities hot spot on a 20 mile run if i wanted!"

I ran over to central park then came back and ran a loop around como lake to get 10. legs felt great, definitely from the down week. tomorrow i will be starting my workouts under my new coach Jeff Morris!

It definitely wasn't strenuous but just not as relaxed as i was hoping. On my rest i would jog a lap then wait for until 2 minutes then start the next rep. The workout got started off terribly on the warm up. I figured that since it's march, i don't really have to worry about the cold anymore, so i dressed fairly light. well, i was in pain the entire warm up and failed to get warm at all, but rather just painfully cold. when i got back i checked the temps and it was -5 with -15 windchills...im dumb"

This workout was pretty low on intensity but the short rest made it somewhat tiring. felt pretty smooth and relaxed the entire time. i would have done 10 but my legs were starting to hurt from the sharp indoor turns. after 3 indoor workouts this week i really need to make sure i don't overdo on that thing and end up injured."

For the hill bursts i found a steep hill and all out sprinted for 8-10 seconds. it actually helped my legs to feel a lot better. ankle is still bothering me, but it's not bad enough to worry about it. thankfully, this is my only run of the day!"

03/15/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran this with Phil at Bethel. We did the first four 600's backwards, which allowed my ankle to feel good, but it also felt really awkward and unnatural, so we went the normal direction for the last four. Didn't feel very fast for the 300, but the time isn't too bad. overall my legs felt pretty sluggish. i seriously think the reason is doing them so early in the morning, im not trying to make excuses, but rather just try to diagnose why i haven't felt good on a single one of these morning workouts even though i feel like im pretty fit. i guess we will see this weekend...

also, props to Phil on having a very solid workout. he will be back kicking my butt in no time!"

03/17/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,10.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran with Phil. We decided to do this workout on the transit way instead of the track. We quickly discovered that the way out was much easier than the way back, probably because it was slightly downhill and with the wind. I wasn't worried too much about time, but rather just wanted to relax and run fast. It was a beautiful morning and great to have Phil's company. Felt much stronger than tuesday. pretty excited for sunday's race, hopefully we get good weather."

Hit the bell in 2:52 and thought i could close in a 60, but 50 meters later i realized that that wasn't gonna happen. the bear jumped on the back with 200 to go and i probably ran a 36 last 200. definitely disappointing but the one positive i can take from the race is that i didn't throw a fit afterwards like i have in the past. good day."

I ran an out and back from minnehaha falls out on the west river road, then took the franklin ave bridge over to the east river road. the plan was to run the first 4 miles @ 5:20, next 2 @ 5:00, next 3 @5:20, next 1 @ 5:00, next 2 @ 5:20, then last 1 @ all out. 

Splits were: 5:14, 5:21, 5:26, 5:19, 5:06, 5:12, 5:27, 5:17, 5:15, 5:15, 5:29, 5:22, 5:07. 

As you can tell, i sucked at hitting the splits. Not to make excuses, but i swear every mile i had to hit 5 flats there was a hill. For example miles 9 and 10 were both 5:15's although they were supposed to be 5:20 then 5:00, but the effort for the first 5:15 was relaxed, but on the second 5:15 i felt like i was hammering. I thought for sure i would be able to break 5 on the last mile but i was pretty tired. Overall, not a bad workout, although i was hoping it would've went a little better.

At the start of the mile i decided that i wanted to try and go sub 4:50, but when i got running i started tying up and so i just cruised in.

Decent workout, definitely didn't feel amazing, but i accomplished the goal of hitting goal marathon pace. The heat started getting to me the last half of the run, also there were 3 decent sized hills the last 4 miles which explains some of the slower splits mixed in there. Phil started with me and ran with me for the first mile which helped a ton just knowing someone else was out there running with me. On a side note, i started taking iron supplements today, because i feel like i have been really lethargic lately, and that could be because of low iron levels. Hope it helps!

The first 20 mins wasn't bad other than my legs being a little tired. Then at about 3 miles i had to go to the bathroom, no big deal, 5 mins later my stomach started reeeaaallly hurting, like unnaturally bad, so i went to the bathroom again. Came out of the bathroom and took a step and then had to go back in. By this time, nothing was coming out anymore (sorry for the graphic-ness of this story) but my stomach felt terrible to the point where i couldn't even run. After a few more stops i finally made it back to my apartment, but i still needed 18 mins to get my 10 miles for the day. So i ended up grabbing a roll of TP and running 9 x 2 minute out and backs to get the last 18 mins. This ensured that i was never more than 2 mins away from a bathroom. I have no idea if i got food poisoning or what. Overall, i ran for 70 mins but the total time the run took was 1:41, so i had 31 minutes of stoppage time which ended up making me a little late for work. Thankfully this is my only run for the day. I am hoping this doesn't happen on my long run tomorrow or else i will probably have to skip it and do it another day.

My next 2 miles were 5:30, 5:31, then my next 2 were 5:40, 5:42, so i just stopped. It was very frustrating.

I definitely wouldn't have, but thankfully i still got 29 days to get there. Overall, super encouraging workout knowing i can go 18 at goal MP without feeling very good.

Ran this workout solo from the round-about on the west river road. Got out a little harder than planned the first mile, so i just kept it even on the next two miles, then picked it back up the last three. Even though it was a good workout i felt pretty off. I'm hoping that it was just because I overdressed. I opted not to take any clothes off after my warm up, but even after 1 mile i was already really hot and it just got progressively worse throughout which made it kinda hard to breathe at the end. Oh well. I would much rather be sweating than cold!"

If I looked at this year in review last year at this time, I would've been pretty depressed. Thankfully, i don't feel too bad about it now. First time in my life I didn't increase in mileage, I actually dropped by 300 from last year. Overall, it was a pretty disappointing year running-wise. I didn't get any goals that I set for myself, but there were a few bright spots throughout the year which helped keep me motivated. 2012 will be a very interesting year for my running and my life. I have absolutely no goals for running. I will be in South Africa on a mission trip from Feb 2 - July 1, so running will definitely take a back seat during that time. i'm excited to see what God has in store for this year!"

It was raining pretty hard so it wouldn't have been a very fun race. The prize money ranges from about 35 grand for 1st to about $1,000 for 10th, so there were some big time runners.  The race got me excited so I closed the last 3 miles at tempo pace and ran 16:15. I've definitely lost a lot of race sharpness over these last few months."

These workouts definitely haven't been as easy or fun as I thought they would be. I was planning on doing 5 miles in 26 mins, but I got 3 miles in (15:30) and felt like I was gonna pass out from being so hot, so I stopped. Took a 5 min break then ran a mile in 4:55. Took another 5 min break then ran a mile in 4:54. I'm feeling nowhere near race fit, but the good thing is, I am surprisingly ok with that.

I remember thinking �man, my heel feels good today!� At right around 3 miles I went from feeling great to not being able to run at all, the pain was crazy. I had trouble walking back to the locker room. I ended up leaving work early to go to the doctor. There isn�t a break which is good, but it�s probably some type of soft tissue tear, I will get an MRI soon and that should be able to tell. I�m actually on crutches which is pretty humbling, and I can�t put any pressure on it without having shooting pain all over my foot. I was pretty down about it yesterday, since I won�t be racing or maybe even running for quite awhile.

Thankfully this morning I was able to get up early and spend a lot of time in the word with the Lord. And I just felt so much peace about it and almost an excitement that this is where the rubber meets the road in living out what I believe. It can be easy to say you believe the Lord�s promises when things are going well, but when there is a bump in the road that all of a sudden becomes a lot more difficult. Two verses that I will really be clinging to in the next couple weeks are: Romans 8:28 which says that God works all things together for good for the those who love Him. And James 1:2-4 which says that we are to consider it pure joy whenever we face trials on this earth because we know that the testing of our faith will lead us to maturity, so that we will not lack anything.

Coming in, I was really doubting my fitness. But i went out smart this time and I felt great at 7 miles. I remeber thinking that I might even have a shot at the OTQ. But then I started feeling the pace a little bit at 8 and really just lost it mentally for some reason. i remember thinking at 8 miles that I still had another 25-26 mins of racing left and that seemed like an eternity. So I ended up falling off the pack i was with and ran in no man's land the rest of the race. I ended up kicking one guy down at the end which is always fun. On one hand, I was very surprised I felt so good physically, I actually felt a lot better than Grandma's and I was definitely in better shape for Grandma's, but on the other hand, I don't know when I turned into such a mental midget. I contemplated dropping out from mile 4 on. Overall, it was a super fun weekend and it was a good re-motivator for the year!"

I jumped on the track for the last one and ended up feeling alright, but it was definitely getting tough the last mile. Good confidence booster for me after last Saturday's workout."

I convinced Sam to join me for the first 5 miles which was nice, then I tacked on 5 miles solo. At one point, while adding on solo, I heard a vicious bark and turned around to see a pit-bull type dog running after me about 100 meters behind. Thankfully a car drove by and honked at it and it turned around and went home. Unfortunately, it was an out and back and there is no alternative route around this house as there is a lake on both sides of the road which is only about 1.5 miles from my uncle's cabin. So on the way back I was feeling pretty uneasy as I approached the house. From about 150 meters out, the dog spotted me and sprinted down towards the road, so I turned and booked it the opposite way. After waiting for about 5 mins for the dog to walk away, i decided I would walk in the ditch across the road super casually past the house, but again, when I was a far ways off the dog came tearing down to the road and looked ready to kill, so once again I ran back the other way. After that I tried flagging down 5 cars but none of the them would stop, which was kind of surprising. At this point, it had been about 10 mins and I was getting pretty cold. So I found a tree and broke off two fairly large branches and then decided i would wait until a couple cars were in view then i would make a break for it. Finally, there was a string of 3 cars coming so I made a break for it with the sticks in hand. The dog came crashing down the driveway and had it's teeth bared looking like it wanted to rip my achillies out. The first and second cars whizzed by and at this point the dog was pretty close and so I was swinging the sticks back at the dog and sprinting at the same time. Thankfully, the third car slowed way down and started honking at the dog and this startled it and I was able to break away from it. Once I realized I had escaped the dog, i was completely wiped out. I probably ran the previous 400 in 65ish. I was so flustered and upset for the rest of the run, but thankfully I was able to get it out of my system and enjoy the rest of the day.

At that point Berens fell back and I ran the rest of the race alone. I ended up feeling really good which was a pleasant surprise.

Although it was only a 0.7 second PR, this was my first PR since June 2013 so I will definitely take it. Overall, I actually felt like I didn't race too well.

Sathre and Wintheiser broke away and then I ran the rest of the race with Campbell and Easker.

I ran 4 miles with Stephen and by the time we were finished I was soaked and pretty darn cold. In hindsight, I should have just gotten a ride home but at the time I thought I'd be fine. Well the 3 miles home were right into the wind and the rain continued to fall. With 1.5 miles left my fingers and toes were painfully cold and I was shivering. I had a mini panic attack at this point because I knew there was no where to stop because I would just get colder so my only option was to make it back home. I ran pretty hard the last mile but that didn't seem to help warm me up at all. When I got to my house it literally took me 2 mins to get my key out of my pocket and finally get the door unlocked because my hands were so cold. Once I got inside I put my hands in a bowl of hot water for a very painful 10 mins and then after that I was finally able to get my shoes off. Then I took a 20 minute HOT shower which felt amazing.
