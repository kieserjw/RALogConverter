Injury in November and running through that to nationals.  Then having a terrible course and tearing myself up on that.  Followed by 20 days of doing nothing at all.  Gaining 20 pounds. Coming back and having the same ankle pain for the first two months back running. Running some subpar races and then about three days and one workout with out pain. Slipping on ice and straining my lower back and right back to where I started.  If there was ever a winter to be hurt and not be able to run at least this was it.  The sidewalks continue to be covered in ice, the footing everywhere is bad and the polar vortex continues to pound us with negative temperatures.  It could always be worse."

Well I never write. But I am feeling inspired here. Lots of people blog and people must read it otherwise they are just wasting their time. Not sure what I will write. Maybe I don't cuz I know I can't be as witty or amusing as Nick Ross but running 100 miles a week I must have something interesting to say. I was thinking about it as I jogged back after what you could call a workout and feeling sick. Lets say that eating 3 brats right before running hard isn't the greatest idea, but I am a champ so I kept them down. As I was doing MP and 10k pace which are much slower now than they use to be I was thinking about where I am at. As my friends and teammates are doing workouts that are as fast as my two races I have run this year I decided I am in a funk. The only way to get out of a funk is to run out of it. So I headed to Dam to Dam last year I had no expectations and I head there again this year with the same. Hopefully this year can get turned around."

Went through 800 and ran 200 more but felt like I was only using one leg. Had no response.  Never dropped out of a race before. Shouldn't have started even but hate to let that mentality sink in. Not the person to drop out. Thought that I was hurting and the team didn't need me so I let that thought into my head. I am going to take time off and really get healthy.  Basically haven't been healthy since last year. Still ran 15:40 and 1:13 with a bum leg and without having great training.

Did the first part with Marotz.  First one was tough second felt better.  Was wondering what I could do in miles.  Rest was 3 minutes between 2.5 and 4 minutes between miles.  Felt great.  Very happy with this workout.  I am confident that I can PR in both 10k and half marathon.  No way I could have ran a sub 5 as my 7th mile of a workout like this when I ran my other PR's.  Have to keep pushing another few weeks."
