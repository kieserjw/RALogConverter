By the time we made it to the hot springs (just before sunset, luckily) we were all exhausted. We made a quick dinner over a camp stove, set up our tent, and went to bed.

Ran the first 8 miles on the Military Ridge Trail, then hopped into a trail race at the park.  Ran the first 25 min. or so of the race with Cory, but the effort was getting to be too much for a long run so I backed off to normal long run pace.  That course is nasty, including lots of hills, turns, rocks, tree roots, etc... I don't think there will be much trail racing in my future (I didn't enjoy trying to run fast on such a technical course).  Legs felt kind of blah."

We started the run at about 7000 ft., and as usual the altitude gave me some problems.  Zach lives at altitude so it wasn't affecting him nearly as much as it was me, but I was able to hold pace.  60 minutes into the run my mouth was completely parched (dryer weather than I'm used to, higher breathing rate due to altitude), but I figured I would be fine since we were just doing an out and back and we should have been back in 45 minutes.  Well, we ended up getting lost, and I had to start walking at around 1:45 into the run.  My mouth was so dry that it was difficult to swallow, I started getting light-headed, we had no idea where we were, and it was getting very hot outside; I started to freak out a bit.  Luckily, after about 30 minutes of walking, we found our way back to the correct trail and ran the rest of the way into where we had camped.  Our 3rd friend, Brandon, had already contacted the park rangers and they were out looking for us.  An eye-opening experience, to say the least.  I always thought I was fit enough to handle getting lost for a bit on a trail, but apparently not so at 7000+ ft., 100 degrees, and on tired legs."

5-6x1600m at 10K pace with 60 sec. rest at the indoor track. Had a good group of guys to work out with: Cory, Jerome, and Brian Finnel.

Was feeling good through 3, and then Jerome led the 4th interval and went a little too fast (I could have slowed down, of course).

The first interval felt tough, but doable.  On #2 I started to tighten up quite a bit, and realized doing #3 probably wasn't a great idea.

The temperature was perfect for the race; 50 degrees at the start.  There was a stiff wind out of the West, which meant we'd be going straight into it for the 1st 1-1.5 miles, but then would have it at our backs after that, which I prefer.  John Heitzman was also in the race, and he helped take out the first mile at a good clip (4:55).  It felt harder than I would have liked, but we were going straight into the wind, so I was happy that the split wasn't too slow.  Once we got out of the wind I decided to put in a 200m surge and ended up feeling great after that and never really slowed down.  I reached 2 miles in 9:4x and figured if I had a good last mile I'd have a chance to break 15.  With the wind almost fully at my back now I opened up and started hammering as much as I could.  I hit 3 miles in ~14:23 and new I would be under 15.  Not an ideal race to taper for and finish a season with, but at least it went well and I can start resting my hamstrings."

Race Name: Valentine's Day 5k
Terrain: Road
Warm Up: 3M
Cool Down: 4M with Hanna
Overall Place: 1

First race in 9.5 months, and it couldn't have been a worse day for racing: -15 windchill at the start, 20-30mph winds, and a few inches of fresh snow on the course. Even if the conditions had been perfect, I wasn't worrying about time anyways. I just wanted to race for the win. Got out very relaxed the first mile (5:30), running with one other guy. Shortly after the mile I picked up the pace a bit and dropped him. This is where I could really tell that my fitness isn't great. I got about 8-10 seconds on him by the 2nd mile, but I was starting to fatigue and got a little worried that he might roll up on me in the last mile. I was able to hold that 10 sec. gap until the finish, however, so it all worked out. Considering how bad the course was (ice and snow covering the whole thing), this was a decent performance. I'll take it. Partnered up with Hanna Knurr, who won the women's race in 18:58, so we easily won the partner competition. Fun times. "
