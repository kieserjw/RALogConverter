35 minutes on bike in the Rec. Alternate 1 min hard, 1 min easy. Would've gone longer but had to go see trainer. Going to see Doctor Stephens tomorrow about leg again."

35 min ride. Interrupted by flat tire on my first ride on my new bike at 17 min. Took 40 minutes to fix. Some guy name Julio came and saved me. Rode 17 back."

Starting to get used to the biking concept, but really looking forward to getting back to running. I think I will begin to run again after I see Doctor Kenter on June 9th. Hopefully he will give me something I want to hear on my birthday.

06/01/2008,6:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,23.60,miles,4395,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,5,"Went from house in New Richmond back to UC. Averaged 20.5 mph for the first 20.5 miles (took exactly an hour), then hit the huge 3.1 mile uphill stretch to UC and my final average was 19.3 mph. Felt really good today. Nice weather since I waited until late to ride."
06/02/2008,2:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,17.60,miles,3506,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,8,"Rode from UC to Marriemont and back. Took MLK/Madison all the way out. Bad idea to start the ride at 4:45 due to rush hour. I really should try to avoid that in the future when I decide to ride on busy roads. It was a mess avoiding cars--and the last thing I need is another accident. I'll probably stick to much less busy roads in the future. 

Good workout interval workout though due to all the stoplights and hills. Got me breathing real hard and heart rate probably up to the 190s or 200s at times.

06/17/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,3.20,miles,1305,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"First day here in Boulder training at altitude. Went for an easy run on a trail that follows the creek that runs through town. Absolutely no pain with my leg. Pretty happy about that. I think for the first 2 weeks I'll do 3 days a week of training. Then go to 4 days, etc... 

Felt pretty out of breath though after 3.2. Must be a combination of me not being in running shape at all and the altitude. I keep having this dry cough. I've been trying to take in a lot of water though to compensate. So far so good."
06/18/2008,10:00 AM,Cross Training,Normal,20.40,miles,4354,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,7,"Biked out diagonal highway and back. Got sort of lost on the way back. Pretty worn out after ride. Quads are especially feeling it."
06/19/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,3.00,miles,1311,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,8,"Ran up to Chaqueta Park, up a trail, and then back. All uphill going out, all downhill coming back. I've heard that day 3 is the hardest in altitude. I'm not sure if it's the hardest, but I can vouch that I was breathing way harder than normal and going slower. Part of it was because the first half was uphill though. Tibia has been feeling great so far. Hopefully this keeps up.

"
06/20/2008,2:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,10.00,miles,2498,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Biked up Flagstaff Mountain (2500 ft). Going up the first 1.5 miles was the hardest. After that, it got easier until right before the summit. Took me 28:38 to get up 5 miles averaging 10.4 m.p.h. Then coming down I was just cruising. Took me 13 minutes even to come back down. Averaged 23.4 m.p.h. Maxed out at 38.1. I really wanted to hit 40, but a car was in front of me slowing me down, haha. Felt great though today!"
06/21/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,3.40,miles,1326,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ran up Broadway to Boulder Creek Path, and then back through campus. Starting to feel better in this altitude, but I'm still finishing real out of breath."
06/22/2008,2:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,18.40,miles,4833,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,7,"Up and down Flagstaff Mountain twice. Felt pretty good overall, but second time up was pretty strenuous. Averaged 13.7 and max was 34.9."
06/23/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,3.60,miles,1551,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,8,"Out and back up a trail at Chautauqua Park and back. All uphill on the way out. Altitude still getting to me. But at least leg is feeling good."
06/24/2008,2:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,30.50,miles,5731,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,5,"Up route 36, then a right towards Longmont (out and back). Felt pretty good. Nice long ride today with some moderate hills. Averaged 19.2 and maxed at 35.7."

Legs just plain tired and not feeling very good. I'm getting more confident with coming down the mountain faster though. Still being careful of course!"
07/01/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1556,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,6,"Out and back with Dragan and Bill. Leg feels good still, but I couldn't get in a rhythm this morning and my breathing was all off. Negative split coming back uphill. Out in 13:10 and back in 12:46. Maybe a little too fast."
07/02/2008,2:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,30.10,miles,7271,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,7,"Rode my bike out to Jamestown and back. Grueling on the way out--mostly uphill. Absolutely a blast coming back though. Hit 46.1 mph on the old road bike--it was pretty fun. Averaged 14.9 mph."
07/03/2008,8:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1539,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,3,"Night run with Bill. Felt amazing on Pearl Street. Little bit of a natural tempo and probably hit 5:40-50. Leg is still feeling good. Will keep doing every other day for a while because it's working for me. I hate doing it because I feel like I'm wimping out, but I gotta stay healthy--it's my main concern."
07/04/2008,10:00 AM,Cross Training,Normal,31.80,miles,6173,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,7,"Was going to go out on Baseline, right on Route 42, and then back on South Boulder, but I didn't know Route 42 was also called North 95th street, so I went waaaaay farther than I thought I would. Went out on Baseline all the way to I-25 and then decided to turn around. It was a good call because I got pretty tired. I averaged 18.5 and maxed at 35.5. Rolling hills, but it was pretty windy, so that slowed me down."
07/05/2008,10:00 AM,Run,Normal,4.20,miles,1650,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,8,"Out to Boulder Creek Path and up West into the mountains. Felt like crap. Legs were dead and breathing was heavy. Don't know why. Just felt out of rhythm today."
07/06/2008,2:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,20.00,miles,3825,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,4,"Out and back on route 36. Feeling pretty good. Tried to take it a little easier today to give my legs a bit of a break--they've been kinda sore (from what I have no clue). It was kinda drizzling so it felt really good."
07/07/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1570,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,6,"Out and back with Dragan and Keckeis up the Boulder Canyon Trail. Pushed the pace a bit, but felt pretty good. A bit out of breath coming back. Leg has been feeling good though."
07/08/2008,10:00 AM,Run,Normal,3.80,miles,1598,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,3,"Out and back with Keckeis on the Boulder Creek Path. Broadway to Canyon, then to the tennis courts and back. Real easy pace. Felt refreshing. First time I've done two days in a row! Leg felt good. I think this will keep up. I'm feeling healthy and I'm anxious to increase mileage, but I will continue to be patient."
07/09/2008,2:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,30.00,miles,7217,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,8,"Biked out to Jamestown and back. At 38 minutes got a nosebleed and had to stop for a bit. Then at 29 miles I stopped at Boulder Creek and took a 15 minute ice bath. I was pretty worn out, but the ice bath really helped my legs recover quicker for the rest of the day. Averaged 15.0 mph and maxed at 45.7 mph."
07/10/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1607,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,3,"Down to BCP and then left up Canyon Trail. Out and back to make it four miles when I returned to the creek and then ice bathed with Julia and Michele for 15 minutes. We then walked back to the house. Felt pretty good today. Leg kinda twinged at about 3.5 miles and lasted for maybe 50 meters. Part of the reason why I ice bathed. I'm gonna keep an eye on that. Depending on how it feels later today I may or may not run tomorrow. We'll see."
07/11/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.20,miles,7200,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Went for a hike on the Allenspark Trail. Hour out, then played around in Cascade Falls for an hour (absolutely beautiful) and then an hour hike back."
07/12/2008,8:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1585,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,3,"Night run. Felt pretty good. A little out of rhythm here and there, but mainly pretty smooth. Need to stay more focused on form when running so I don't get into trouble on the longer runs (once I get there in about 6 years)."
07/13/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1639,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,6,"Felt pretty sluggish today. Not sure why. Maybe because there was only 14 hours between last run and this one. Need to eat a little healthier."
07/14/2008,2:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,10.10,miles,2590,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,6,"Biked up Flagstaff. Was going to go up Green Mountain too, but I hit Flagstaff pretty hard and my legs were getting pretty worn out at the top. I made it to the top in 30:52, which I think is my best. Looking forward to running tomorrow because leg has been feeling great."
07/15/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1646,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,5,"Out and back with Keckeis. Felt pretty good. It was pretty hot out today though. Leg has been feeling good. Still feeling sorta sluggish on my runs though. Maybe need to ice bath a little more often."
07/16/2008,8:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1691,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Pearl Loop plus some. Really easy and relaxing. Felt pretty darn good. Leg twinged a bit, but I'm thinking it's just getting readjusted to all the pounding. I'm biking tomorrow anyway, so that'll give it some rest."
07/17/2008,2:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,22.60,miles,3996,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,5,"Bike ride up 36 and back. Was feeling pretty good and relaxed until I hit 35 minutes. Was going to do 45 out and back, but at 35 min I was going uphill and the wind was just killing it against me. I was going like 15 mph with all my effort and my legs were on fire. I thought to myself, 'Man, this is really dumb.' So I turned around and immediately went 27 mph with almost no effort. Still got in a good workout."
07/18/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1605,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Boulder Canyon Path with Bill and Kyle. Felt pretty good today."
07/19/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1613,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Pearl Loop plus a bit. Felt like I was stuck at 6:45 pace and my leg turnover just couldn't speed up. It wasn't like it needed to be any faster, but I felt like there was just a wall there."
07/20/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,0.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Took off. Was going to bike after work, but manager kinda messed some shifts up and I had to stay much later than I thought. Got back after dark. First day I've taken off in a while though."
07/21/2008,10:00 AM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1571,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,4,"Ran the BCP to Arapahoe bridge and back. FINALLY felt in rhythm--for the first time this summer. It is probably because I took off yesterday (which I believe was also the first time this summer). It felt so good to feel really comfortable running again. I also felt a little bit of my passion and drive come back, which has been missing for so long due to my extended leave from real running. I'm pretty happy about today's run and hope that this only continues and I stay healthy."
07/22/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1598,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,5,"Pretty warm out today, but felt relatively good. Not as smooth as yesterday, but I could still feel some of my drive. The big plus is that it was my second day in a row and didn't even have a twinge in my leg. I think I'll go two days on, one off this week, and then next week I may try to go 3 on, one off."
07/23/2008,2:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,6.00,miles,7200,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,4,"Backpacking with some friends through Rocky Mountain National Park. Pretty hilly and I was carrying about 50 lbs."
07/24/2008,2:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,6.30,miles,7200,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,5,"Second day of backpacking with some friends. Once again, very hilly terrain and I was lugging about 50 lbs on my back."
07/25/2008,2:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,15.00,miles,28800,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Hiked up Long's Peak. Started at 2:30 a.m. and got to the summit at 6:57 a.m. and hung out until 8:30 and then came down and got back at noon. Went from about 9,400 feet to 14,255 feet. Very grueling, but the coolest thing I have done all summer. My first 14er."
07/26/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,2093,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,3,"Ran with Bill up to Chautauqua Park and up the Mesa trail and then back. First time that I've done 5 miles all summer and I'm pretty excited about it. Felt good and healthy and I think I'll do 5 tomorrow as well."
07/27/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,2153,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,4,"Ran BCP past the Arapahoe Bridge (out and back). Felt really smooth. Was nice to go two days in a row of 5 miles. Looking forward to getting back into running for real because I'm tired of this lukewarm training crap."
07/28/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,2129,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,7,"Ran on the CU Cross Country course with Dragan. First time all summer that I've gone 3 days in a row of running. Good because I was pain free, but bad because I felt like crap on that course. Just couldn't get into a rhythm, but it wasn't just me--Dragan said he was huffing and puffing too, so I suppose it partly had to do with the conditions. 

Running pain free! I'll try to keep it up."
07/29/2008,2:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1606,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,4,"Ran with Dragan. 4th day in a row! It's a new record. I almost feel like a runner again. Out in 13:40 and back in 13:06. Felt pretty good and just chomping at the bit to get back into it."
07/30/2008,12:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,20.30,miles,3937,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,7,"Biked up 36.  Out and back.  Really windy and really hot.  I was just getting dominated by the wind."
07/31/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,2051,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,5,"Ran up the Canyon trail and back.  Felt like my legs are a little weak, which is probably true in the distance sense.  I need to start getting in some consistent miles before I feel really good.  Overall though, I am really really happy because I'm running pain free and I can tell that I'm making healthy progress.  Don't get a stress fracture, they suck!"
08/01/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.50,miles,2297,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,8,"Ran with Dragan. Felt like total dog crap.  He did too.  Dunno why.  Felt like my legs weighed 100 pounds."
08/02/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,2051,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,3,"Ran with Dragan in Yellowstone.  Cool crisp air on a beautiful morning.  Just felt absolutely amazing.  No other way to describe it.  600 times better than yesterday."
08/03/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,2111,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,5,"Ran with Bill and Dragan on the way out, then just Bill on the way back.  Ran in Yellowstone National Park.  Went out 17:45 downhill and negative split coming back uphill.  Felt really really smooth."
08/04/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,2100,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,3,"Ran down BCP past Arapahoe bridge and back.  Felt just amazing.  Finally getting back into the groove of things.  I think I will try going 5 days in a row next week."
08/05/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,2.60,miles,1056,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Was going to take today off from running and just bike, but everything was against me today.  I was filling my tire with some air and the valve end broke off and the tire deflated in a hurry.  So I went to replace the tube and pinched it with the tool and had to try again with another tube and did the same exact thing.  So then I was going to drive down to the bike shop and pick up a few more inner tubes, but Bill borrowed my car, so I ended up running down there and back.  Finally on the 3rd try, I got the inner tube in without popping it.  Jeeze."
08/05/2008,12:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,36.60,miles,6774,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,7,"Rode bike to Lyons and back on 36.  Great day out, felt amazing.  One of the best bike rides I've ever had.  Really hit it hard on the way back.  1:00:06 on the way out, so I negative split on the way back (52:48)."
08/06/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.00,miles,2377,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,8,"Ran with Dragan and didn't feel too hot.  Ran the BCP, out in 20:15 and back in 19:22 (uphilll).  Felt like my breathing was way off and my legs were heavy.  It seems like I feel like crap the day after a hard bike ride.  Oh well--it was the longest run for me of the entire summer and I'm pretty happy about staying healthy.  3.5 weeks until our first race!  It's not gonna be pretty for this guy..."
08/07/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.50,miles,2249,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,4,"Added some variation to the Pearl Street Loop to make this route.  Nice and cool out tonight after rain most of the afternoon.  Felt really good and smooth.  No pain still--which makes me the happiest.  

Looking forward to feeling like a real runner again.  I feel like I'm getting to the brink right now."
08/08/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.10,miles,2124,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,5,"Same loop as I did last night with Kyle.  Felt fine on the run.  At work tonight, my leg felt a little sore in the spot where I had my stress fracture.  It's the first twinging I have felt all summer.  It could just be my mind playing games or like Lupp (who says his shin hurts every time it rains--and it was raining!).  

I will take it easy tomorrow on some trails and see how it feels.  For now, I iced it."
08/09/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.00,miles,1578,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,3,"Ran the Canyon 4 mile course and felt great.  Around mile 2.5 I felt like my stride was shorter than usual, like I wasn't on a normal cadence, but there was absolutely no pain or even twinge during the run, so that was nice.  Out in 13:38 and back in 12:40."
08/10/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.60,miles,1034,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,2,"Well, I got up at 6 to go for a morning ride and everything was going smoothly--air was cool, sun was rising, little to no traffic, and I was just breezing along until 5.6 miles away from the house I hit a small rock that punctured my tube.  Not dismayed at first, I methodically dismounted my bike and began to change the inner tube.  But, only to add to my frustration, as I was mounting the bead of the tire back onto the rim (using a tire lever of course because I have wire beads and superman couldn't mount the tires back on without using levers), I accidentally gave myself a pinch flat.  Not completely out of luck yet, and with a patch kit and a spare CO2 cartridge, I set to work on patching the tube in hopes of getting myself back up and rolling.  But alas, to my dismay, I either created two holes the first time I mounted the tire, or created a new one on my second try, because as I filled the tube with air, both the tire and my hopes deflated yet again.  Consequently I had to defer to calling Bill at 7:00 a.m. to wake him up so that he could drive my car out and rescue me off the side of the highway so that I could be at work by 9.  What a morning."
08/10/2008,12:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,18.90,miles,3382,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,7,"Due to my little excursion this morning, I went to the bike shop and got myself a set of kevlar beaded tires, which are more expensive, but nicer and much easier to mount on rims (and thus making me less likely to getting stranded yet again).  

Other than that, I squeezed this ride in because I got off work at noon and had to be back at 3. Up Diagonal Highway and back.  Got going pretty fast.  Avg: 20.1 mph."
08/11/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,2007,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,4,"I thought I would be feeling worse than I did because it was the day after my bike ride, but I felt surprisingly good--which was nice.  Ran with Dragan on the BCP and we did 3 miles, then 1 mile of jog the turns and stride the straights on the track, and then finished a mile back to the house.  Good day."
08/12/2008,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,1994,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,4,"Ran Folsom to BCP, then to 30th, then back through 29th Street Mall, back to 30th, and then returned.

Other than that I really tried to focus on running smoothly without strain.  I figured out today that it's a little harder to run at a fast pace easily when you workout alone.  Much easier to run harder with less effort when accompanied.  How the heck did I do that for 4 years in high school?

Legs once again felt really heavy today.  I don't know why I've been feeling so sluggish lately, but I'm thinking it has to do with me not having any base mileage and racing so hard and taking longer to recover.

Hoping that next year I can get in some good training, remain healthy, and perform much better than I did this year.  All in all, God has been incredibly amazing to me this year and I run solely to honor and glorify Him."

I mean, this driver full on nailed this larger woman and her arms flailed up and she got slammed to the ground and then rolled.  Lost her umbrella too.  Dragan and I went and helped her get up after checking to make sure she could feel her fingers and toes (to see if she had back injury).  And then she just kept idly walking around looking for a bus stop and the driver just pretty much took off because she 'didn't want to stop traffic'.

Went for another night run (after learning my lesson yesterday) and felt much better.  But, it was INCREDIBLY windy out tonight.  Probably a constant of about 35-40 m.p.h. and gusts up to 80 m.p.h. or so (the winds were so bad they closed the upper decks on the forward part of the ship and people were taking pictures of themselves leaning at 60 degree angles into the wind).  Which meant that every 90 meters it felt like I was either running up Straight Street, or down Straight Street.  At first it was really dumb, but then I enjoyed it because I finally had some variety on my run, instead of just the same old 9 laps per mile crap."

Not quite a death march, but I felt terrible today.  Perhaps I'm dehydrated, or tired from traveling, or maybe my body is not used to running in the morning, but I felt like I got hit by a truck when I finished and sat like a blob on the couch guzzling water and eating for about 3 hours afterward."

I couldn't even count the middle reps and didn't figure out until logging this that I ran 6 instead of 5.  

Don't know why I feel so bad (evidenced by my inability to stay consistent, which I am normally pretty good at).  Breathing seems to be normal, but my legs and arms just feel like they're flailing all over the place.  Quads are still pretty sore."

Something about the sun just sucking my energy gets to my head (it's basically all psychological). I guess it's because I've had a few horrible races when it has been hot out.

Anyway, about 4 laps in gapped the field a bit, and saw that it was happening, so I hit a 68 (I was averaging about 71's) and increased my lead.  Felt good through 6 laps.  Then at 2 miles felt ok, but not bad yet.  Then, real fast, with 3 laps to go I didn't feel so hot, so I was just trying to hold pace.  I was struggling to hold 71's, so it wasn't pretty.  Not sure what I finished the last lap in, I know it was under 70, but it probably wasn't fast enough.  No competition really.

I need to get more endurance.  I'm falling apart too early.  Hopefully with some more healthy mileage next year I'll be a lot stronger.

Wow.  I felt awful today.  Legs felt mushy and heavy and I was lightheaded.  Just a terrible start to summer training.  

Also, on a side note, I received my altitude tent today and will from here on place an 'Altitude' section at the bottom of my log to keep track of what altitude I'm sleeping at, how I felt while I slept, how many hours I slept, and my pulse rate in the morning when I wake up.

On another side note, this thing looks absolutely ridiculous in my room."

Then from 3-4 miles all I wanted to do was stop and walk because my breathing was all out of wack and my legs felt terrible.  Then after I hit about 30 minutes, everything kind of evened out and I felt fine after that.  

I think it probably has to do with several things:
1. Only 5 or 6 hours of sleep the past few nights because of the last week of classes
2. I keep throwing down coffee like it's my job to stay awake
3. I ate a variety of small things and took medicine 45 minutes before run.
4. It's the first week back?

Those are my conjectures, but basically, it's no big deal and I'm sure I'll be fine."

Felt relaxed the entire way--didn't strain the entire time.  I never got around to breathing hard either and when I finished, I felt like I had just gone for an easy morning run on the standard.

It would be amazing if my long runs continue to feel like this.

Perhaps I felt so good because I took a 3 hour nap at altitude before I ran and the altitude stimulates the natural production of EPO?  I don't know.  That was just something I was pondering on the run."

My legs were feeling pretty dead during stretches and drills, but then once we started the repeats, they got around to feeling a little better.

Then for the pressure run: a totally new thing to me.  It was a really good race pace threshold run.  I led both of the pressure runs for most of the time.  I felt really smooth and in the zone on the first one, but then started feeling it a lot more on the second one (coach cut it down to 7 min from the original 10 min).

Dumb drive back from New Orleans. I really need to take better care of myself.

Ran EPO - XU (sign). 8.4 miles in 1:00:04 (7:09 pace). Felt really good on the run, but I honestly thought I was going about 6:45 pace. Maybe it was the snow on the ground throwing me off.

Back to Armory and did the following:
3x600 in 1:48, 1:48, 1:47 (1:48 goal pace/5 min cycle, jogged 200 between each)

For the first time that I can remember, I fell on a run. I was almost home--right by the Campus Cyclery and American Apparel and I looked left and *boom* I was on my hands and knees sliding. It stung my knees pretty bad since it was so cold out.

On the way back up MLK hill, the wind was howling so bad in my face and I was slipping on the snow that I was pretty much running on a treadmill. It was terrible."

1. Heading up Vine street from St. Bernard, I passed a couple of thugs and one yelled at me 'Ya, you best be jogging b*tch.' I'm a runner, not a jogger.

2. As I passed the zoo, an old red car was in a vacant parking lot doing laps and drifting in the snow on each turn. I stopped and watched a couple laps because I thought he was going to run into a fence.

3. Some frat boys at Stratford tried running with me for a bit, but the one complained that he had too much Boost in his system, so they stopped (totally unexpected).

4. As I left Bellevue Park, there was a tall black guy in a black coat with his hood up walking down the line of cars on the street pulling on each door handle to see if they opened. When he heard me coming up behind me, he turned around real quick, and then tried to walk away casually. I almost asked him if he was having trouble getting into 'his' car, but I didn't want to have any trouble since I was almost home. Didn't see a cop to tell on the way back to the house.

Also, near the left shoulderblade on my back has been incredibly tight on runs and hurts like a mother. I put a heat pack on it after the run, but it still didn't loosen up much. I really need to have it massaged out or something.

Except it was only me and Lupp that got lost, as Book split off early and miraculously made his way back. 

West side: -4 points. 

1. The first guy Ricky tried asking for questions straight up blew us off. Didn't even wind down his window, shook his head, and swept us away with his hand and then drove off. Dirty dirty west side.

2. Snow all over LaSalle's track (which is to be expected, but since Lupp wanted to do a mile at the ol' Alma Mater, -1 point for west side). We did a miserable lap on it.

3. The car's in LaSalle's parking lot were scattered around and parked every which direction like some toddler had thrown his matchbox cars down on the floor before going to play with some other toy.

4. I can't even remember what the other one was, but the guy blowing Ricky off for directions counts for at least 2."

Legs have been sore from the mileage I've put in the past 4 or 5 days, but I'll take the next 3 days easy as I will be volunteering at a camp down in Florida and I don't think I'll have much time to run.

Pretty good workout today. I was pretty pleased with my times and how I finished. It was pretty tough though. I had to put forth quite a bit of effort on the 1000s to hit the time.

Not sure if I should be going this hard this early, but it felt good to feel fast again.

Randy said that my 5k race equivalent (effort) was 14:20. Of course, you can't ever fully trust those numbers anyway, but it's nice to hear.

Went and visited ol' Camp Friedlander and did a lap around cabin row (1.22 miles). It was pretty nostalgic.

On my way back, I did 4 miles on the Loveland Bike Path. Picked it up a little on there and was cruising 6:50's. So I would say that an average pace of 7:06 is pretty reasonable.

Cool-down: 

Ran the workout outside today! That was nice to get back on the 400m track. 

Pretty happy with how the workout went. Unfortunately though, I didn't feel very smooth. Felt like I was just clunking along on the track, bouncing back and forth with each stride. Not sure why I didn't feel like buttah.

Legs had a decent amount of spring to them, but nothing spectacular. Finished well on most of them and started to feel it by the last few repeats. 

Had a bunch of phlegm in my throat that I kept swallowing on the cooldown. By the end of it, I felt like throwing up and I kept spitting all over the place. Consequently, I couldn't eat very much for dinner because my stomach felt so full. So that pretty well sucked.

MIT was incredibly disappointing. It looked like a prison compound, with the exception of one amazing building complex that would have put DAAP to shame.

As she did, Scott came down the stairs on the other side of the house and so I shouted at her (still through the door), 'Oh, sorry, Scott lives on the other side!'  She didn't even turn around.  I was devastated.  No acceptance of my apology.

Anyway, once I shook that off and gathered my scattered emotions from the snow covered sidewalk, we started moving along.

Felt amazing on the run.  I feel like superman.  I talked to Lupp about it on our last mile.  It's so awesome being in crazy aerobic shape.  I finished and wasn't even phased.  This distance used to be my long run.  Now it's just another day in paradise.

Felt like total crap on the cool-down.  I had an allergic reaction to something in the armory and then whole time cooling down, I felt like I was about to sneeze.  It was like a tiny bird had nested in my nose and kept ruffling its feathers.  It was awful.

Some car came really close to us while we were running on the road at DeSales corner, and Lupp yelled at them 'What are you doing!?' and I held my hands up in question at them.

Ran from home back in NR. It was so refreshing, but also so strange. For the first time, I looked at my hometown as I ran through it as a stranger. Not much has changed, but as I went along, I took in all the sights through distant eyes, rather than ones who were familiar with the run down homes, the empty parking lots, and the short-lived businesses. It was a very odd feeling.

Oh man.

I roasted the first 5 and got my legs pretty sore pretty fast beating the 800 guys, and then reality set in when we had 25 more to go instead of 10.

So then I slowed them down a bit and tried to get into the zone.  15-25 went by pretty quick, and then really had to focus on the last 5 to hold it together.

Overall though, it was a good workout.  Really ended up getting both quantity and quality."

Then we didn't get to play it all the way through anyway because all the Air Force guys came into the Armory and were doing their 1.5 mile fitness test and asked us to turn our music off.  

12 minutes.

12 minutes to run 1.5 miles.

Getting it in early with Lupp.  When I woke up, my body was pretty sore and didn't want to move, but after a few miles, I really settled in and felt MUCH better than last night.  Back to normal.  That was comforting.  

The last few miles were straight into the unceasing wind.  That got pretty cold.  My hands went numb.  Should have worn another shirt under my jacket.

Wow. What a ridiculous run. 

Scott got hit by a car at 17 miles in at the intersection of Clifton and Ludlow and got a bloody elbow. Other than that, he was ok. It was a hit and run with intent--the dude fully accelerated turning left into Scott while we were crossing the street. They had been calling us fags for our shorts, and then just plowed right into Scott.

We tried to get the license number and then found a cop on Ludlow and filed a police report. They have a search out for the car.

So the last 3 miles of the run went by really fast because we were talking about Scott getting rammed by the car.

Really happy with today's run--my legs felt great."

Breakdown: Day 1

Felt fine at the start of the run, then really had to do some serious work once we hit Newport, so I ran inside and destroyed a toilet.  After that, digestive system felt better, but once we hit Eden Park, my body was shutting down on me.  I felt awful.  For the first time in a very long time, I had neither a good day or a great day--I had a bad day.

I skipped Bible Study tonight and went to bed as soon as I was done with dinner.  Got about 9 hours of sleep (I'm writing this the next morning--I didn't have the will to write it last night) and I'm feeling a little better now, but my body is still just plain tired all over.

I feel like I'm getting sick, but in reality, my body is just totally broken down and worn out right now.  

I'm trying to take care of it and get as much rest, fluids, and nutrition into it as it can handle."

Surprised myself today.  I felt 16 times better than yesterday.  This was probably the biggest difference I've ever felt between two days' runs.  

So, surprised in a very good way.  

There is a secret: 9 hours of sleep.  I felt completely rejuvenated after it.

Great team workout today.  Everybody hammered hard and the last two 400s were so quick because our main man Book took over and showed us the miler gear.  Really good stuff.

Ran alone tonight for the first time in a while.  It was a nice little breather from monotony (sorry Lupp, doesn't mean I don't love running with ya).  

Felt like junk the first 5 miles because I inhaled a cliff bar right before the run and I don't think I chewed it as much as I should have.  Idiot.

Once I hit Rookwood, I really started feeling good and just rode it all the way home, thus the quicker pace.

Ran with Lupp.  And also with Chazz Andersen.  

A very unique run.  The first time we've ever had a football player join us on a run.

Ran out just past Boncker's, and Chazz joined us for the 2.7 loop around Hyde Park.  It was pretty funny, but also a good time.  He started out strong, but then  faded pretty hard once we hit the incline on Edwards.  And once he was in oxygen debt, he stayed there.

Felt kind of bad about it...oh well.

Anyway, didn't feel as good as I would have liked to this morning.  I think it's because I woke up so funny and because I usually have a cup of coffee before morning runs--today I had no time since I failed to wake up.

GREAT workout today.  Interesting how I felt.  Took me a few repeats to get into the groove, but then from 8-13 or so, I didn't feel so smooth.  I remember thinking at 10 that there was NO WAY I was going to make 20.  But then, from 15 to the end, I felt amazing.  Incredible.  I got a superman second wind.  Honestly, I felt like I was almost jogging.  I felt like Lagat on that last lap of the 3k at Doha.  If I can feel like that in a 5k, I'll be in the money.

Once we hit 2 miles though, Lupp was struggling a bit and coach told me to chase after the leaders, who had about 7 seconds or so on me.  

So I put my head down and cranked it into another gear. 

It was a good day, and a nice day to win, but I really would have liked to see Lupp finish a little faster (15:05).  I know it's in him and I know he'll get there.  Baby steps.  33 second PR for him.  Do that one more time and he'll be in the money.  I know he's in shape.

Anyway, I didn't feel as good on the last mile as I would have liked to.  Even though I picked it up, it should have felt easier than that.  I just keep thinking that if I'm trying to break 14 this year, I've got quite a while to go.  

Just can't let it get to my head.  Hopefully next week I start reaping the fruits of my labor down at Raleigh."

Coach came up to me at 2:15ish and asked for me to cover Rutherford's anchor leg in the 4x800 literally 10 minutes after I polished half of a large pizza.  I thought he was kidding, but he really meant it. 

My stomach sort of shriveled up immediately, but then after talking it over with Rick King, he decided that he would do it (right after he threw down a calzone). He's the MAN.

Made it through the run just fine with a little bit of rain and a little bit of shine.

At 11.23 miles, there was quite a pungent aroma of Fruit Loops cereal on Madison Road.  The Fruit Loop bandit tempting us.  

Now, sitting here and logging this at 7pm, my body is pretty darn beat and tired.  I think a lot of this is due to my absolutely terrible post race diet the last two days (and I guess the awful sleep patterns with driving home at a very late/early hour).  It's very difficult to eat healthy on the road, and my body is suffering as a result. 

Get some good rest and food the next few days and I'll be back to normal.

I had to push to make the 600s in time, and I pushed the last 800 of the last mile to simulate racing a little better (this workout was 3mi of quality with very little rest), but then coach said that I was pushing harder than he would have liked.

Great workout today.  One of the best I've had in a long time really.  I was incredibly focused during the whole thing and visualized myself in a race (seeing that it was at race pace).  Did 4600 meters of quality at race pace with only a few jogs in between intervals.

Felt smooth and relaxed for most of the intervals.  Had to push a little on the end of the 1000, and then I pushed a little on the last quarter.  Other than that, all I tried to focus on was good form and steady breathing.

Overall very pleased with this workout and I hope that I can just put this all into a race.

Getting it in.  Not enough sleep and too much homework.  Need to try and get more sleep this week.

Most exciting thing to ever happen on the standard this morning.  The transformer across from the King's house was on fire and blew up when I ran by it.  It literally looked like a firework shot out of the transformer and then the telephone pole caught fire.  

It was so sweet.

Then within 4 minutes, the fire department showed up to douse it out.  Good fun."

We did a swing mile from DeSales Corner to just past Bonker's in 5:39 (slightly downhill).  Felt really smooth and relaxed.  We talked the whole time without much effort.

Then we did a tempo mile from just past Bonker's to just past DeSales Corner in 5:13.  That required a little more effort because we were going slightly uphill.  It also started raining buckets on us by the end, which was kinda cool.  It really helped to cool us off and felt really nice, but by the end, my shoes had doubled in weight.

05/29/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Race,7.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"There's a lot I can say about this race, now writing this a week after it happened.

I will try to be concise, but also write enough such that I can look back and reflect upon what happened here so I can try to prevent it from happening next year.

The race conditions really weren't that bad, although it was a little windy on the homestretch and it was still humid out.  But everyone has to run in the same conditions, so that needs to be set aside.

It was pretty nerve racking the first 3 laps when I was caught on the rail and everyone was clipping each others heels.  I really tried to just relax and go with it, but found that it was difficult to do when everyone was pushing and shoving.  So the first mile, I just couldn't relax and get into a rhythm.

I then took the lead over the fastest 10k runner in collegiate history.  But hey--he was slowing down and didn't want to take the lead, so I decided, 'what the heck' and went for it.  I didn't even feel like I sped up, it's more than the dude from Harvard that was leading was slowing down and motioning for Chelanga to pass him, but he didn't, so I just went wide and to the front.

I then ran 67, 69, 69, out front, until I just got destroyed.  I came through two miles feeling it, but it really wasn't that bad.  I came through 2 faster than I have all season, but only by a few seconds on average (only 1 second faster than Sea Ray).

Then, with 4 laps to go, the crap just hit the fan (SEE: Race Splits below).  I don't know what happened.  When those guys went around me in a chain, I didn't mentally give up, I just couldn't get my body to respond.  I even was telling myself, 'alright, relax, you'll be fine--you'll get up with them and hang alright.'  But my legs and body just shut down.  I was even feeling the lactic acid in my  friggin' forearms.  

My form almost immediately went to rec-runner levels and I couldn't relax for the life of me.  I kept telling myself to relax my shoulders and move my arms forward, but I just kept running like Emil Zatopek, the human locomotive, (except slower) out there.   

Finished feeling worse than I have in a really long time, and I'm totally not happy with it, but such is sport and life sometimes.

So here are my thoughts on my preparation that I have had over the last week:

1. Too much of a taper.  Last time I tapered to this extent was in high school, and I also ran like crap that time as well.

2. Mental expectations.  I cannot any longer let Big East be the emotional peak of my season, even though I tried to avoid it this year.  I must be thinking NCAA or bust.

3. Sleep/eating patterns.  Coming into the race, I had tapered so much that my appetite had gone down and my sleep patterns were changing because I was just chillin' at the hotel.  Even though I thought much more sleep and rest would help, it is a deviation from the norm and maybe that threw my body for a spin.  I dunno--these are just some theories that I had.

4. Altitude Tent.  My last night at altitude was Tuesday, so I had 3 nights without it.  Perhaps I should have tried to sleep at altitude longer (even though not possible since we traveled) before racing?  Like aforementioned, these are all just theories that I want down in writing so I can come back and reflect upon it later.

*Experimental Workout*

K-Mack and I were talking at the NCAA Prelims about this workout that Andy Gerard used to have the guys at Stanford do.  Hall and Dobson did this workout back when they went 1-2 at NCAAs, but they would do it with 64s and a 58 hammer lap.

Either way, the idea behind this workout is to get comfortable, at a certain pace (69s for me), then be able to hammer a lap (64) and then settle back into pace.

I was surprised with myself today.  I honestly didn't know what to expect.  Second day back and my legs were a little sore after jumping right back into the routine yesterday, but I was able to finish the workout.  At first we were just going to do maybe the first 3, then I told myself to do 4.  Then after 4, I (and Mack) was able to convince myself to go out there and 'just cruise 3 easy laps and then finish hard.' 

I had to push it today to make the times.  I need to get to a point where this feels relaxed and easy.  

I know this is a pretty hard workout for the second day back, but I decided to do it anyway.  My legs were definitely aching, but they never felt like they were going to give way (or give into injury), so I think it's ok.

Call me crazy, but this workout was a lot of fun."

Legs were stiff and sore to start out due to the quick turnover from run last night.  Didn't get as much sleep as I would like either because of the dumb dog whimpering and barking starting at like 5am.

Really didn't feel all that great today and had to push it to finish.

I still don't feel recovered from my trip to Jamaica."
07/04/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,8.80,miles,3691,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Portage Lakes State Park - 8:04am

Ran some trails today, but then ran out of trails and added on 2 miles or so on the roads.  

Legs still are still lacking a lot of spring.

Wish they had some more pop in them and that I felt fresher.

Again, didn't get great sleep thanks to the dumb dog.  It was also really hot last night and I sweat pretty much the whole night without any sheets."

Warming up, my legs just felt like junk.  Haven't slept nearly as much as I would have liked the last week. Legs are still recovering from the training in Jamaica, and yesterday I worked outside all day with my Dad installing a new sliding door at my grandparents house.  So I was not ready to go today.

Collmar asked me before the race how I felt, and I responded, 'Like crap.'

That proved to be true.

I was 28 seconds slower than last year.

Just need to get back into the routine of training and give my body a better opportunity to recover from my training."
07/06/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,1965,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Standard - 5:00am

Ran with Lupp and Tommy. Whole body is sore from this past weekend and legs felt like junk.  It was also already hot and humid out this morning, so that didn't help.  Sweating like a water park."
07/06/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,9.70,miles,3989,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Winton Woods - 6:02pm

Ran with the fellas doing the workout for their w/u, then ran until 50 min with Berling, then finished up on my own.

Blazing hot out today.  CORRECTED BY A KING: It was actually 90 and 40% humidity, not 95� and 80% humidity or so.  

Heat advisory in effect.

Just drank a lot of water.

Good news is that my legs felt better than I expected them too for this run, thus why I went 9.7 instead of a wussy 8."
07/07/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.70,miles,4400,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Hyde Park - Grandin - 6:08pm

Ran with Skeet, Lupp, Williams, and Book. Hot out. Very hot. Legs felt pretty decent though, but everything is overshadowed by that dumb pain in my upper left back near the shoulder. I really need to get that looked at soon."
07/08/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,1922,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Standard - 5:00am

Ran with Lupp and Tommy.  Pretty tired this morning.  Had Bible Study last night and it went until 9:30, so I didn't get to bed until about 10:15.

Hot.  Really hot and humid."
07/08/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,8.00,miles,2972,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Fernbank Park - 6:10pm

Ran the first 2 miles with Book, Tommy, and Randy.  Then we started a 4 mile tempo and Book and I got a little ahead since we planned on a faster pace for it.  Went 5:45, 5:46, 5:36 (downhill), 5:54 (uphill).

Pushed a little more than I probably should have--didn't feel as smooth as I would have liked.

After the tempo, had a hard time settling back into 7min pace, thus why the overall pace was so quick."
07/09/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,1862,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Standard Loop - 6:15am

Ran alone.  Tried out the Saucony Guides since they got in yesterday.  They felt pretty good. The heel counter sits a little lower on this shoe than the 2140s.

07/11/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,17.30,miles,7179,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Peninsula Tow Path - 10:22am

Got a late start this morning after sleeping in.  Thought I was going to feel like crap today, but we got on the tow path and it was crushed gravel and shaded the whole way.  It was amazing.  Felt really good on the run and was pumped it went so well.  Great run."
07/12/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,1992,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Standard - 5:00am

Ran with Lupp, med-ball routine with Tommy. Average morning, nothing special."
07/12/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,8.50,miles,3565,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Grandin Loop - 5:30pm

Ran with Skeet, Lupp, and Book.  Decent run, but legs didn't feel all that great.  What killed me the most was my back again up near my left trapeze.  Still trying to find the number of that chiropractor that I met a while back who seemed like he knew really well what he was doing.

"
07/13/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,1960,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Standard Loop - 6:10am

Easy morning run.  Wanted to do 4 doubles this week, and next week will be 5.  Legs started out pretty sluggish, but then felt better after 2 miles."
07/13/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,11.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Winton Woods - 6:10pm

Felt really flat on the w/u.  Started the workout after ample stretching and drills.  Legs felt better once the workout started.  Felt really relaxed on the first two.  The last one was a little harder, as shown by the time, but still very relaxed.  This was a great aerobic workout.  I really like these 2 mile repeats."
07/14/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,1945,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Standard - 5:00am

Ran with Lupp. Tommy and Lupp partnered up today for the routine and I played friends with the wall.

Legs felt surprisingly good today for a workout yesterday and not much sleep last night."
07/14/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,8.20,miles,3385,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Bellevue - Lafayette Cir. - Mt. Storm - 5:35pm

Ran with Book, Lupp, and Skeet.  Good run.  Started out feeling a little stiff and sore, but worked my way into it and was feeling much better by the end."
07/15/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,12.00,miles,4567,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Avoca Park - 6:10pm

Started with Lupp, Book, Berling, and Tommy.  Berling broke off at 3, Book at 4.5, and Lupp and I passed Tommy when we started the tempo.

3 mile w/u (6:51, 6:57, 6:53)
5 mile tempo (5:42, 5:37, 5:36, 5:39, 5:25)
4 mile c/d (6:34, 6:59, 6:56, 6:52)

It was a really good tempo, but perhaps a little too hard for today.  It was really hot and humid, so it made the tempo that much more difficult. I think I was focusing too much on time and staying with Lupp (fastest kid alive).  He broke away from me on the last mile and I huffed my way back to him in the last quarter mile.  

Again, I think the effort was a little too much for me today.  I need to get some lightweight trainers.

I was really tired after the run and super dehydrated all night."
07/16/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,1923,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Standard - 5:00am

Ran with Lupp and Tommy.  Really hot and humid out this morning.  Just ridiculous.  Does it have to be this hot and humid, even this early?

Sweat a pond on the mats this morning.

Abs were sore, so we went a little easier on our 42-pack ab routine this morning."
07/16/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,8.10,miles,3298,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Grandin - Back on William Howard Taft - 5:42pm

Ran with Lupp, Skeet, Hauser, and Scurry (two new freshmen). Was pumped to meet and run with the new guys.  

We went a little quicker today than I thought we would.  I was really wanting a recovery day after yesterday's tempo, but today didn't end up being too hard. 

Hot out.  Really hot."
07/17/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.20,miles,4296,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"KY9 - Fairview - 7:36am

Ran with Skeet this morning.  Kept it nice and easy because my body is tired from the last two days of running.

We started off in the 7:10s, but then worked our way down to 6:50s by the end, but everything was nice and relaxed.  Good recovery day."
07/18/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,17.00,miles,7125,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"New Richmond - 8:16am

Ran with Lupp and Juice until 12, then Juice broke off to head back home and Lupp and I kept going.

Ran up G-Hill at the end. Got me breathing pretty good.

Surprisingly felt better than I thought I would.  Good long run.  Nice running around the old stompin' grounds again."
07/19/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,2001,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Standard - 5:00am

Ran with Lupp, K-Mack Routine with Tommy.

Tired and sore this morning from the long run yesterday and then spending the day down at Williamstown Lake boating and swimming."
07/19/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.00,miles,4303,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Winton Woods - 6:57pm

Went to see Dr. Lindeman before the run for a chiropractor appointment.  It seems that my back has been hurting on runs as a result of an s-curve in my spine near my neck that was caused by my bike accident in 2007.  He said that my ligaments were probably strained from the impact and everything got out of alignment.  So he took some X-rays, made some adjustments, and I'm going back next week to see him again.  He gave me some stretches to do to help out with everything.  I'm optimistic about it and hope that my back will be feeling better soon.

Ran with Lupp later after we both had an appointment.  Glad we ran later because a storm was rolling in and made for a much cooler run.

Started off feeling like junk for the first 4 miles, but then things loosened up and felt fine by the end."
07/20/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,1952,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Standard - 5:40am

Nice easy run.  Weather was really nice.  Enjoyable way to start off the day.  It was refreshing."
07/20/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,11.00,miles,4864,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Winton Woods - 6:00pm

Ran the workout with Lupp and Bookmeister.  Really good workout.  Eased our way into it and it started storming pretty bad by the third interval.  That cooled things off and made for a nice workout.  

Was pushing it a little at the end, but nothing out of line.  Felt like I could have gone another few, or gone faster if I had so decided.  

Great workout today and I sort of surprised myself."
07/21/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,1940,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Standard - 4:30am

Ran a little earlier this morning due to having a dermatologist appointment at 7:30.  

We sweat.  A lot.

It's so humid out."
07/21/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,9.50,miles,3987,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"KY 9 - 5:38pm

Ran with Lupp, Tommy, and Bookster. Started out feeling not so hot, but worked my way into it.  I think Lupp felt the same way.  

Legs feeling much better by the end of the run, but back is still hurting.  Going back to see the chiropractor on Monday.  

No Roller Skate Girl on the bridge today.  Maybe if Scott was with us she would have been there."
07/22/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,1959,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Loop - 6:05am

07/22/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Tempo,10.00,miles,3753,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Miami Whitewater Park - 6:10pm

Did a 'tempo' today.  It was supposed to be a tempo, but I quickly turned it into a progression run.  I didn't mean to, but I ended up feeling pretty good and just went with it.  Wore the Adistar Tempos and they felt much better than I expected them to.  I was surprised with how well they cushioned.

3 w/u (7:12, 7:01, 7:05)
5 progression (5:37, 5:30, 5:18, 5:10, 5:01)

07/23/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.50,miles,2777,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Standard - 5:02am

Ran with Lupp and Tommy.  Lupp pulled a T-Wiliams in Bellevue.  I felt pretty bad for the dude.  He ended up being able to walk it off and caught up with us a bit later.

Added on after the K-Mack routine to get in some more miles this morning because I'm traveling to Pittsburgh tonight to visit my brother and wanted to do a shorter run once I got there."

Awful, hot, hilly, bad run.

Tried to run on some horse trails where my brother told me to go, but they got super narrow and it was just terrible.  Did not feel good and I was way overheated."
07/24/2010,12:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,0.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"BIKE - Pittsburgh

Went for a 52.3 mile bike with my brother and his friend from college.  We started at 10am and didn't finish until almost 4:00pm. It took us forever, but it's because we took a bunch of breaks at the top of all of these ridiculous hills.

Actual ride time was 3:33:13, so we averaged 14.7mph.  Not really that quick, so the ride ended up being more leisurely than I thought, but the hills still made me do some serious breathing.

"
07/24/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.00,miles,2042,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Pittsburgh - 7:25pm

I had planned on going 8-10 miles today, depending on how I felt after the bike ride.  I felt great and would have gone at least 8, but we were pressed for time before dinner.  I convinced everyone to wait on me while they showered and got ready and I snuck in this short quick run before we left.  

I actually felt pretty good. That was surprising."
07/25/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,20.00,miles,8390,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Pittsburgh - 7:53am

Got a good night of rest after yesterday and started off feeling a little sore.  First two miles were in the 7:50 range, but then I picked it up and started cruising about 7 min pace.  

Got to about 14 and was still feeling pretty good, so I decided I would go farther than my planned 17-18 mile run.

Picked up the pace around 12 miles (last 8 miles were 6:49, 6:49, 6:45, 6:47, 6:39, 6:35, 6:38, 6:31, 6:42 uphill) and just went with it.  Really got in a good groove. 

Great run and it ties my longest run ever!

This was a great end to my 'Amazing Aerobic' weekend."

07/27/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,11.00,miles,4445,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Winton Woods - 6:00pm

Felt like junk on the w/u.  Just really heavy and slow.  Once we got into the woods though, I was feeling much better.

Felt really smooth on the first and second repeats.  On the third one I pushed a little bit on the second lap, but nothing that was unwarranted. 

Really good workout today.  Very happy with how things went.

Felt real sluggish again on the c/d."
07/28/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,2048,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"K-Mack Standard - 5:01am

If there was ever a run that was all over, today was it.  We ranged from 5:25/mi to 7+/mi.  And then Lupp had to pull a Hauser on Wendy's.  It was hilarious.

Anyway, this was a decent run--I just wish the pace had been more consistent."

Moscato was supposed to meet up with Lupp and I at my house to start the run, but he never showed up, so we started.  Then, 30 minutes later when we were on Sheakley, here comes Moscato just trotting along.  He got lost on his way over to the house.  I guess next time we'll just meet him where he is.

Legs felt good this morning.  Felt better than yesterday.  Got 8.5 hours of sleep last night and it was amazing.  The first time I've gotten 8+ hours in over a week."

Ran with a pretty big crew today! Lupp, Skeet, Berling, Book, and Barry.  It was a good time.  

Started off the first repeat a little quick, but we settled in just fine.  Breathing was a little hard because it was so humid out (temp was in the upper 80s, but heat index cranked up to 97). 

Second repeat was even quicker, but I just jumped on the Lupp train to glory.  He pushed the pace a bit and I just followed.  Tried to stay as relaxed as well and did a pretty good job of it.  There were a few instances where my form degenerated for a few strides (mainly due to the footing on the trail), but I would quickly correct it.  

Breathing was pretty heavy by the end, but I still ended feeling pretty good.  

Great workout today.  Second interval is equivalent of a sub-16 5k, and it felt good."

Ran alone this evening after playing worship at Mt. Carmel.  It was a nice change in pace--scenery and all. 

I was glad I ran after the sun was going down as the heat index tipped the scales at 108� today.

Running alone gave me some time to evaluate why I do what I do.  Run, eat, work, run, eat, sleep.  Every day.  Sometimes it becomes a prison.  I feel like Quenten Cassidy, trapped in the small house in the woods, imprisoned in February. But instead, it's June, July, and August, and I live my life workout to workout, surviving the droll and dull lifestyle that it inevitably procures.   

At the end of my run, I stopped to stretch underneath a small pergola that overlooked the river, with the glow of Cincinnati illuminating the hills in the distance.  It was purely spiritual, and reminded me that God has blessed me beyond measure."

Ran a little later today with Lupp and Skeet.  Great run.  Weather was finally cooling off a bit and legs felt fresh with plenty of pop.  Finished the run feeling strong and refreshed."

Ran with Lupp.  Legs were sluggish, but the weather was nice and crisp out this early, so that really helped the run go better.  Lupp made me look like a freshman going up Ravine at the end of the run.  

Wish legs would have felt a little better, but it'll all work out."

Ran out at the Book's farm this morning. Ran the first 2 with Berling, Barry, Lupp, and Book. Then went until 16 with the latter two. Didn't feel so good today as it was pretty warm out under the sun and there wasn't much shade.

Started feeling a little better after the first 7, but then by 12 miles I was absolutely dehydrated. By the time 16 rolled around and we got back to the farm, I felt like I was licking a salt block.

Got some water at the farm and Lupp and I tacked on a few more miles to make it 20.

Glad the run was over. I was not feeling too hot by the time we finished."

Ran with Lupp, Book, Skeet, and Berling. Packed house tonight.  Berling ran the first one with us and then had to call it quits because of his achilles.  Props to that guy: the dude absolutely loves the sport.  Gets done with the first interval and then says, 'Guys, my achilles hurt the whole way, but that was the best 10 minutes and 46 seconds of my summer.'

Anyway, wasn't feeling great today, a little due to some DB 21st birthday action last night, but primarily due to the fact that the heat index was about 108�.  

Just tried to stay smooth and relaxed.  Perhaps a little too hard on the last interval."
08/11/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,1912,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard - 5:00am

Did the K-Mack Routine in the track hallway this morning, where there is some A/C.  It was glorious.  The armory, as per usual, was about 100�, so it was a good choice.

Legs are a little tired."

Ran with Lupp and The Bookmeister in trails at Mt. Airy. Trails were up/down/all-around, and we did the first 6 or so inside.  Then we gave ourselves a break from all the twisting and turning and finished on the roads.

Legs are tired and it's hot.  Very hot.  Heat index hit 110� today."

Had to start later today because 1) I was giving a tour around the athletic facilities to a group of Kenyan Basketball Players that were in the US via Athletes in Action, and 2) Scott got in a wreck in front of our house and we had to wait for the tow truck to get there before we could all leave.

So, having the late start out of the way, we finally got out to Avoca.

Ran with Lupp, Book, Tommy, Mindel, and Lang.

Felt pretty junky on the w/u and the first mile of the tempo, but then settled in and got into a decent rhythm, just not a great one.  It was still really hot and humid (heat index 100�+) so that definitely made the run harder.

Overall, a good workout today, given the conditions.  Wish I would have felt a little more relaxed though.

3 w/u (7:04, 6:58, 6:58)

Ran with Lupp this morning. It was much cooler out, so it felt pretty nice.  Legs felt pretty good, but I was a little short of breath coming back.  Hit up the turf on the infield of the track for 4 laps with strides every endzone for a total of 8 strides.

Got a little bit of a late start this morning, but it was worth it to have so many people there.  The lineup:
Lupp
Morgan
Book
Mindel
Barry
Ra. King
Hauser
Scurry

Went 5 out and back one way, dropped a few people off, then 5 out and back the other way.  Mentally, this was really easy to do.

Felt really good on the run today.  I think it's the best I have ever felt on a 20 miler (this is my 5th time now).  It was still humid out, but the temperature had dropped and it was overcast.  Made for a very relaxing run.

Picked up the pace at the end to run to the barn and we closed in 5:40, feeling very comfortable.

After I broke off, I picked up the pace a bit, but then I realized my legs felt like junk.  By the time I finished the run, my legs felt like 100lbs each.  

Forced myself to do some striders and drills barefoot on the turf following the run."

Went out there just wanting to get some miles in and something a little quicker.  The course was certified this year, so it was a legit 5k.  To be sure, I measured it with my garmin on my w/u and it was dead on.  

Anyway, just went out quick and tried to focus on form and fluidity, especially during the last 3/4 mile or so. I was definitely getting tired near the end and it was taking a toll to try and keep everything moving at the same speed.  

Not great, but not bad.  If I can do this in the middle of a 100+ mile week, I guess that's a good sign.  It'll all pay off in the end."

Woke up this morning and didn't have a voice.  My throat has been sore the past few days, but today the vocal cords just didn't want to do it.  Body felt fine, and my throat actually felt better though.

Ran with Lupp, Book, Skeet, Tommy, and Dave.  Lupp started out like an old man out of bed this morning, but after about 6 miles, we all grouped together and moved along well.  

After 11, it was just Lupp and me.  It was nice and cool out, overcast, and we finished the run moving pretty well.  

Overall, a very good run and route.  Point-to-point routes are pretty dang fun."

Ran with Lupp, Skeet, Book, and Barry. Wasn't feeling the best today.  While sitting at work all day it seemed that I just got more sick and congested.  I just didn't feel too well.  Then on the w/u, I was feeling pretty crappy.  

Got into the workout and started out the first one nice and easy, behind everyone else.  That first one seemed to clear my head up a whole lot and on the next one, I focused on keeping good form and staying relaxed.  

By the third interval, I was feeling pretty good and just went with it, powering up the hills and feeling fluid with my stride. 

So it actually ended up being a pretty darn good workout, even when I thought I would be hitting 11:00 for each interval going into it."
08/25/2010,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,4.30,miles,1797,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard - 6:32am

Welp, this morning was a total blunder.  I forgot to set my alarm, so when I woke up I thought, 'man--I'm really well rested.'  Then I looked at my watch and saw 6:27 and I thought it was lying to me.  I scrambled to look at my phone and it confirmed that I had forgotten to set my alarm and slept in.  

I felt pretty bad for missing the morning K-Mack Standard and leaving Tommy hanging when I told him that I would be there in the morning to join him.  

So I bolted out of bed and clipped along my morning standard route pretty fast this morning, mostly from a combination of not wanting to be late for work and feeling bad for having missed my standard routine.

But looking at it now, it was a blessing in disguise because I have been feeling a little under the weather, and sleeping in allowed me to get 8.5 hours of sleep instead of 7.  Also, I am actually feeling much better today, so it seems like my body needed it.

My deepest apologies to the morning workout crew, Lupp and Tommy, for being a chump."

Ran with Lupp, Book, and Tommy. Tommy lead the way. Went downtown then headed west toward the terminal and got on the train tracks. It was pretty fun, but the footing was awful and after about a quarter of a mile I had my fill.  Came back up tbhe super secret staircase and by the time we got back to the house I my legs were pretty tired and my back was killing me.

Then went back with Lupp to Atkinson, did 4 strides, and then came back home."

Great morning run with Lupp, Bookmeister, and Beckmann. It was awesome running with Beckmann again for the first time in a few months! Legs felt really good and refreshed this morning. Finished the run feeling really good and had plenty of energy for the rest of the day, as I had to move completely out of my house.

Only downside was that my back tightened up and hurt a little bit around mile 13, but I gave it a quick stretch and it didn't get any worse.

Pulled a Nick Ross and did back to back long runs in the same week to boost my mileage. Had to because we're leaving for camp tomorrow and not doing a long run once we get there.

Also saw Extremely Happy Black Man next to XU's campus. He was very nice."

Igloi Workout with the team today. It was actually a rather easy workout. My stomach wasn't feeling too hot because I drank too much orange juice this morning trying to help my throat feel better. All it ended up doing was making my stomach uneasy.

We never really got to working very hard in this workout. I really thought we would have at least 1 set that was a gut buster, but it never came. It was a good, very aerobic workout."

We ended up running in front of Jackson High School in front of the big classroom that had a huge window so the students saw us all run by.

Then on the way back, we went back in front of the same window and the whole team leapfrogged across the whole side of the classroom. It was awesome."

Also since we're moving into the new house, wanted to get my longer run in this morning since moving into the new house this afternoon is going to be pretty hectic.

Good run, but my back tightened up about 3 miles in, so that made the run much more uncomfortable than it needed to be. 

By the time I was finished, I was feeling pretty sore and tired.  I think this may have a lot to do with my sleep (or lack thereof) last week and moving this past weekend."

First team workout back in the N@ti.  Wanted to go a little harder today--make it hurt a bit.  Definitely achieved that goal, but perhaps slightly overachieved, as shown by the last 3 repeats where I couldn't maintain ~5 second cutdown on each one.  

The 2nd and 4th repeats were a little quick, should have run more conservatively, but I got too excited.

Last 2 repeats I ran alone, and that made it more difficult to keep dropping time.

Good workout today--quite a shock to the racing system.  It's XC time."

Ran just as the football game was getting out, so I just tried to run where there wouldn't be people because it's so annoying getting ridiculed.  I know our sport doesn't manage to have the same popularity as football, but I'm out there running and thinking, 'I'm a pretty good runner--probably better relative to other runners than most of the football players relative to other players.'

This proved to affect the workout to a small extent as my cardiovascular system felt like it was ready to go, but my legs couldn't quite respond like normal.  At least this is to be expected.  I've been trying to make sure I've been getting plenty of rest and taking care to ice and massage my legs.

Overall, despite the condition of my legs, this was a very good workout. More like a high-(un)steady-state workout.  Felt like I was getting a tremendous amount of benefit at lactate threshold and am quite pleased with that.  The actual Igloi ended up being 8.6 miles at 5:58/mi."

Ran with the Bookmeister early today since both of us have class conflict and can't make team practice.

Drove down to Eden Park so I could take some cones with me to set up the course.  Just warmed up and cooled down there.  That was nice because then I didn't have to run the hill on Dorchester.

Weather was about 50 degrees and drizzling, which was a little chilly, but made for a workout in conditions which define a cross country runner.

Lungs were ahead of my legs today as my breathing was mostly under control, but my legs were suffering first on the harder repeats.  Overall, body handled the workout very well today and form was good.  Pleased with how today's workout went.

Looking forward to racing the All-Ohio on Friday and doing some serious work.

Long log today, lots to say:

Easy w/u down to Salway.  I dropped behind the team as they were running pretty quickly in the middle, but we all finished essentially together, thanks to the light on Spring Grove.  

Stretching, then drills.

Ran the 700s pretty well and felt pretty good. A little dizzy and lightheaded at first, but that may be attributed to the double shot of espresso I took before the workout to try to stay awake in Heat Transfer (awful professor).  

Then we got the pressure run, which was definitely the heart of the workout.  I have been thinking about this workout for days, as it was pretty well known that this was going to be the hardest workout of the season.

Went out pretty well on the first one and slowly increased the pace as the run progressed.  It ended up being a pretty nice progression and I felt very good, relaxed, and smooth.  In my mind, I'm thinking, 'why can't I make this happen so well in a race?'

On the second pressure run, we got out pretty well, and then after about 2 minutes, Book took off like a mad man at about 4:15 pace or so.  Surged really hard and he almost dropped me, but I coughed up some courage and went with him.  It was good for him to do that to me and for me to have to question myself.  I need to learn how to respond to that in a race.  Ended up running really well.  By the end, I was breathing pretty hard, but I tried to hold form and stay relaxed. DB pushed me pretty hard at the end, which was great to have that kind of competition when I was hurting.

Overall, a very excellent workout today.  My two mile splits during the pressure runs were 9:19.9 and 9:07.0 according to the Garmin, but I would have to presume that those were a little off due to the short turns of the course, but they couldn't be off more than 10 or 15 seconds I would have to think.  

Now if I can just string something like that together in a race.

Looking forward to Pre-Nats."

Got going pretty well on the workout and was winded by the end of the second set (the second set was pretty tough).  

Focused on staying relaxed during the workout and trying to restrain/suppress unnecessary movement.  Thought about how I felt during the race at Pre-Nats and just tried to relax.

Pretty good weather for the workout: overcast and lightly raining on and off.

This workout needed to be similar to a pushup--something to get us locally tired, but not overall body tired.  I think I accomplished that for the most part.  If anything, I went a little on the hard end with these repeats.  I was breathing pretty hard at the end of each repeat.  I'm just not used to that sort of speed right now.

Coach really wanted to do a workout in Burnet Woods today.  I'm not really sure why he wanted to do a course that he hasn't done in about 15 years and have us test it out for the first time the week before the Regional Meet.  

Not only do I think it's pretty bad course for late season sharpening, but we didn't even know where to go: thus why each distance is different.  Coach kept changing the course each interval.  It was incredibly frustrating.

A coach is there so you can have complete faith in him and he can give you (the athlete) confidence to do things that you didn't think were possible.  Today was a day where I severely doubted Coach's commitment to smart training and having a plan.  I'm usually a pretty optimistic guy, but when we have a key workout late in the season, I want to be focusing on how I feel during the workout--not thinking about which turn I'm supposed to make and whether the course is going to change on the next interval.  It made it incredibly difficult to get in to a groove and read my body.  

So there--I'm vented.  But still frustrated that Coach would toy with the whole team like this so late in the season.  If this was around camp or over the summer, who cares?  But this late in the season?  

Anyway, I guess the workout went ok.  I was definitely breathing hard during the workout due to all the hills, but my body didn't feel too tired on the cooldown, so maybe it wasn't as hard of an effort as it may have seemed during the intervals."

Ran a workout with the team today. Got my boss to let me get out early once a week on Tuesday's so I can run the workout with the team, which makes it way easier.

A little windy today on the backstretch, but I actually felt pretty good for this being the first workout back. I'm pleased with how it went and how it was largely aerobic. Just the kind of workout I needed for this time of the season.

Ran at Winton Woods today because the park is right next to where I work. I really ought to take advantage of this more often so I'm not running on busy streets all the time. Any, 3 mile w/u, 5 mile tempo, 2 mile c/d. Warm up and cool down were pretty cool because they were in the woods and it was snowing so it was like this winter wonderland. Unfortunately, that made the tempo not go so well because it made the path pretty slick. I was sliding every step, so my pace definitely slowed down a bit. Even with that though, I was moving pretty well given the conditions. I think I might have been down in the low 5:20s had I been on dry asphalt. Either way, the effort was good. If anything, it might have been a little too hard because it was pretty difficult to relax with all the sliding I was doing.

Ran with Book and Beckmann for the first 8 miles then ran the rest alone. Was feeling pretty good through 12, but then at mile 13 I started having some stomach problems from the breakfast bagel that I had eaten at 11:30.

Was feeling rather sluggish and sore this morning. I think it's from the ski trip and then not feeling too hot at the end of my long run yesterday. Plus I didn't get nearly as much sleep as I should have last night (~6.5 hours). Thus, this all resulted in a less than par morning run and workout.

Skipped bounding in the K-Mack routine and only did 6 sets of squats instead of 10.

Well, had to cut this morning short because once I got out and moving, my right foot was pretty sore. If I pronated normally or overpronated, I got some sharp pain, so I decided to call the run quits before I overexerted something else while compensating.

It seems to be one of the peroneus nerves in the right foot and it hurts when I evert and dorsiflex my foot. I also have pain when I plantarflex with my toes on the ground and apply my body weight. 

The pain is on the lateral side of my right foot, near the very edge and just distal to the ankle. 

Going to ice and take some anti-inflammatories and see what our trainer has to say."

Got on the elliptical in the weight room for just over an hour and got in a pretty solid cardio workout. My foot doesn't hurt at all doing this motion, so I may stick to this for the next couple of days and then try running easy on Thursday or Friday.

My best guesses on why I'm injured:
1. Too much of a mileage increase from week to week (93 to 104)
2. Too much of an intensity increase (0 workouts to 2 workouts last week)
3. Pushed myself too much on the long run
4. Running and slipping on the snow may have caused some muscles to over exert themselves, thus placing extra strain on the tendons, which is why they're inflamed."

Ran with Tommy and Randy. Much warmer out today (34�), but there was still snow on the ground, so it made it a bit treacherous, which I was worried about with my foot, but it was fine. 

As much as I was worried about the tendon in my foot, after about mile 6, I started getting a pain between my 2nd and 4th metatarsals. It was sporadic, but when it came, it hurt pretty bad. I figured it's probably because my foot muscles are a little weak right now and I'm not wearing my orthotics with a metatarsal pad to relieve the pressure up there. 

Tomorrow morning I will throw those orthotics back in and see what kind of difference that makes.

Armory - 4:26pm

Had my first speed workout after the whole foot ordeal. Got to run it with the team, which is super nice. I was really pumped to do this workout with the fellas. 

The first mile didn't feel as easy as I would have liked, but it wasn't hard--I just didn't feel smooth and effortless. 

Went out too quickly on the first 400--went through the 200 in ~30 and Book and I stomped on the brakes. Then we got a feel for the workout in the Armory and started cruising the times.

Coach had 68s written on the workout sheet, but I was feeling really good going a little faster than that. Didn't hit anaerobic until perhaps the last 2. And only on the 2nd 200 of the 2nd to last one. 

Overall, very pleased with the workout and my fitness level right now. Hopefully this will sharpen me up a bit for the Rod McCravy invite this weekend."

Ran this workout alone in the Armory. Well, there was nobody running with me, but there were certainly plenty of people in the armory. There was 2 high school teams, a youth club team, and an AAU team. There were people everywhere. Luckily, I only had to dodge people 2 or 3 times. For the most part, they were pretty good about staying out of lane 3.

Had a very good workout. Extremely pleased with how I felt and how smooth it went. Got right into the rhythm and clicked off the times, feeling very good while doing so. Kept checking my watch every 200 on the first 4. Need to learn to run workouts more by feel, so I didn't look at my watch at all on the 5th and just focused on running smooth. Ended up going faster than I wanted, but it felt good. And of course, I had to finish with my fastest. Had to push a bit on the last lap to get the time.

Mostly a comfortable aerobic workout. Feeling very pleased with my fitness right now."

So I trekked my way over to the Armory and ran inside.  

Following the run, I did P90X Yoga for the first time.  Boy, did I underestimate that.  My back, knees, and ankles were cracking like crazy.

Ran a workout today with the team.  I was looking forward to this workout because I knew it was going to be quick.  Was looking forward to getting the legs moving at a decent clip.

I got paired up with Griffiths and we ran pretty well.  Ended up in 2nd place behind Team Book/Ross.  I think Griffiths was putting a little too much effort into it--I kept telling him to relax.  But I know he was just being competitive and wanted to finish the workout well.

I have mixed emotions about parloff relays.  It makes a workout really fun and enjoyable and helps it go by very quickly, but it also tends to cause people to over exert themselves, as we all want to win. The case is even true for myself, as I was feeling it in my legs in the 7th interval, where if we had done straight quarters with rest, I would probably have felt more relaxed through 10.

The workout was tough, but not necessarily hard.  My legs were just tired from racing on Saturday and then long run yesterday.  So they really had no pop or drive to them today.  Thus, none of it was really that fast or hard, but my legs were feeling it the whole time.

Got it in and tried my best to keep form and stay smooth.  Didn't quite accomplish the latter during the whole workout."

Did P90X after the run.  Only did the second half of the workout since I hadn't done that yet.  Seemed like just a lot of stretching.  Since my time is limited, I think I'll stick to the first half since it is strength and stretching."

Ran in Akron with Book, Lupp, and 2 guys from Akron.  This was a pretty bad run.  I didn't sleep much the night before (~5 hours) and I had a pretty bad headache when I woke up.  My stomach was upset the whole run as well.  

After the run, I didn't have an appetite for the rest of the day and felt like I was going to throw up almost anything I ate.  It was pretty awful.  Consequently, my muscles were pretty stiff and sore because I wasn't able to get any nutrition into my system. 

Going to have to take the next few days easy until my system settles out.  I can't keep pushing it when I can't get enough food into my system to nourish my body."

Warm out.  Started running with Tommy, and then the heavens opened and the wind swept like it was the perfect storm.  Getting hit by rain drops so hard it felt like hail.  

We dodged our way into the Armory and finished our morning run in there.

Legs felt very sluggish.  Body was pretty tired during routine.  I skipped over the leg stuff (squats, lunges).

Did my first workout ever in the Bubble today.  It felt very different running the workout on turf.  It gives a lot.  Much more than the track. Makes your legs feel heavy and sluggish instead of quick and snappy.  Takes a little getting used to, but it's a good surface to run workouts on without giving your legs too much of a beating.

Clearly, we didn't know how slowly we were going on the first one, and then compensated on the next.  Then the group settled into a good groove and we cranked them out.

Felt like junk for the first 3 and wasn't sure if I was going to be able to finish the workout, but then I surprisingly felt much better by about 7 through the end.  Still coming off this sickness, so I didn't expect the workout to go well, but it went better than I expected.  By no means was it an amazing workout, but it was a decent one."

I had originally planned on a 4-6 mile swing, depending on how I felt, but ended up doing 5 miles of a light progression.  I was pleased that my legs responded and I was able to get moving the way I did, but I wasn't too happy with my effort level.  It felt pretty close to a full out tempo effort, and I didn't feel nearly as smooth and light as I would have liked.  But I guess I need to give myself some leeway after being sick the past 2 weeks.

It's funny how long I've lived in Cincinnati and how little of the downtown area I've actually seen.  Ran with Lupp and Book and we winded our way through all sorts of alleys and tiny roads downtown exploring places we had never seen.

Then we had the most amazing timing ever somehow and ended up right at the beginning of the BockFest parade literally as it was starting.  It was so sweet.  At the front they had a live goat pulling a wooden wagon with a wooden keg of bock beer in it.  It was so much fun to watch.  There were all sorts of crazy floats and stuff in the parade.

Coming back up Clifton I was breathing pretty good and my legs were definitely feeling it, but I think that's just pointing to the fact that I'm sort of diving right back into high mileage this week.  I'm guessing that's why I've been feeling a little sluggish all week and tired all around.  Once I get a few more weeks of this consistently under my belt, I'll be ready to go."

Ended up running into Westfall on Ohio and ran with him for a few miles.  That was nice catching up with him.  Legs felt a little sluggish, but still good overall."

Plus the Ohio river is flooding right now, so when we ran over the Roebling Bridge, a barge went under the apex of the bridge just as we were.  The captain was standing on the top of the observation deck of the tugboat to make sure they were going to clear the bridge, and as they came into view, I seriously could have hung off the side of the bridge and given this guy a high-five.  Instead I just opted for a wave and a hello.  It was the closest I've ever seen a boat to the top of a bridge.  It was pretty neat.

We chatted for a while and then when we finished near his place in Hyde Park, I ran home.  I wanted to only go 10 today, but his house was further away from Clifton than I thought, so I ended up going a little too far.

Great workout today.  Got into a rhythm pretty quickly after the first 4 or 5 intervals and then just settled in.  Was feeling very good and smooth.  Got a second wind at about 17 and was feeling great.  Coach wanted us (the remaining Book, Barry and myself) to stop at 20, but I convinced him to let us go 24.  I was really feeling good and my legs weren't even all that tired on the cool down.  I think I could have done 30 today at that same pace.

Did the workout in the matumbos.

Pretty tough workout today.  I dug a little deep, and maybe shouldn't have gone as hard as I did.  Was feeling it by rep 6, and I just tried to stay smooth and relaxed, which was not especially easy given the wind (pretty strong on the homestretch). 

Ran the workout alone because I kept the rest jog pretty quick (right about 6 min pace).  Workout was 4.5 miles done in 22:25, including jogs (4:59/mi).

Man, it feels great to sleep in.  I should be getting up earlier to get my day started, but I had night class last night right after the workout, and I had to drink coffee to stay awake during that, which then postponed the time at which I could fall asleep.

Plan was to do an easy 5 tempo today and try to go as easy as possible.  I would have liked to have gone out to Avoca, but I didn't feel like getting up earlier to drive out there and back before having to leave to head to the meet at 9:30am.

So I just settled for the next best--Hyde Park loop.  It seems pretty flat compared to everything else in Cincinnati on normal runs, but you realize how hilly it really is when you're doing a tempo.  Anyway, it just meant that I didn't get into as much of an easy rhythm as I would have liked.  I still felt pretty good during the tempo and overall it went very well and was easy, but it just wasn't effortless.  I think had I gone out to Avoca, I could have hit 5:10-15 pretty easily and smoothly.

Splits for the tempo:

There was a changing 15-20mph wind on the track, so it made it much more difficult to run the workout.  There was almost no wind following that 800 on the second 600, and that was probably the easiest interval of the workout.

I'm not sure that I should be doing this kind of short fast stuff just yet--I think I should still be doing aerobic interval stuff, working on stamina and all, but this is what Coach prescribed.

Got a later start this morning.  Woke up at 5:45 to get going by 6:00, but I really needed the extra hour of sleep, so I allowed myself to do so.  I think it was a good decision after not having slept much this past weekend.

This was all over the place.  I had told Coach that I wanted to do mile repeats with a hammer lap, or surge portion, in each interval so that I could prepare myself for races when people played those tactics.  What I had in mind and what he had in mind were pretty different though on the first mile.  I'm thinking that he'll give us only 1 surge per mile, 200-600 meters in length.  Instead, 200m in, he calls out a 300m surge, which we respond to.  Then coming around 400 meters later, he calls for a 400m surge.  I blatantly looked at him, raised my arms, and yelled, 'that's too much'.  So I just cruised the rest of the mile.

After the first mile, I went and talked to him and he replied, 'Yeah....that was a bit too much--I don't know what I was thinking.'

So then after the first mile, I was pretty upset with there being so much confusion surrounding the workout.  Either way, I just tried to focus and visualize being in a race and trying to stay calm,

By the end of the workout, I was feeling much better about everything and it was a solid aerobic effort today.  I felt pretty good with all things considered and could have done another mile if it was required.

Ran the workout in the Streak 2."

Two reasons for the '&#931;&#931;' standard. 

1) Got dragged into staying up late again last night for the &#931;&#931; meeting.  I really don't like staying up past 10 and these guys are great, but they just don't understand the commitment to sleep you have to make in order to be a successful endurance athlete.

2) Both Sheakley and Gettler lawns were being used, so I just ran over to &#931;&#931; Commons and then back.

Rabbited in a 1500 for Baum and Collmar. Pretty much hit the right splits dead on for them, but I didn't feel all that good doing it.  I just think I felt way worse than I would if I was actually racing because I wasn't mentally into it at all and didn't follow a proper nutrition plan going into the race.

Unfortunately, neither of them hit the Big East qualifier of 3:55.24, but Baum did run well with a 3:59.9."

Went out to get in a tempo run following the rabbiting to get in a solid workout for the day.  Planned on doing a good 4 mile tempo, but I got out there and totally felt like junk.  Not sure why.  I'm guessing it was because the rabbiting took more out of me than I expected.  Additionally, it was a warm afternoon and I'm thinking the pollen count was high as I was having trouble breathing while going up the uphills. The uphills were really just taking my breath and energy away.

So I ended up cutting it short at a 3 mile tempo as I didn't want to overstress myself.  Here are the splits:

Got up and ran all around Cincinnati cheering on friends in the Flying Pig Marathon.  It was the first year I've been able to watch it since being in college because it is usually the same weekend as Big East. A little longer than I had planned on today, but some of the miles were pretty slow and recovery like, so I don't think it's such a big deal.

Anyway, pace was really all over the place.  Fast when I was running around between parts of the course, and then extremely slow when I jumped in to run with people for a bits of the race here and there.  Here's a list of my splits to get a sense of the inconsistent pace:

Ran an Igloi workout with Scott.  It was really hot and muggy out.  And all this humidity just came out of nowhere and we went from dry to humid so fast.  Thus, it felt like running in a rainforest or something today, except we didn't have the luxury of shade. 

Anyway, legs are still feeling like they have 15 pound weights embedded in them.  Still ran some decently good times on some of the intervals, but I just didn't feel very good doing it.  Tried to focus on staying smooth and relaxed.  Kind of surprised myself on that last 400.

Calf was a little sore after the workout, but it's feeling better overall.  Hopefully I can shake this crappy feeling out of my legs soon.  It's been the perfect storm for bad recovery this week, as I am way behind in my classwork and have been neglecting getting proper sleep to try and get all my schoolwork done, which is just killing my recovery.

Great workout on the track today.  It was pretty interesting how we ran this one.  On the first interval, Dave would jump in randomly and run some random length at a randomly harder pace.   I would have to respond to his moves, much like I would have to respond to someone else's moves in a race.  Nominal pace was 68/lap.  

On the second set, I had to try and drop Dave for 2 laps, then I cruised 2 laps alone, and then he jumped back in and tried to drop me for the last 2 laps.

On the third set, Dave tried to drop me for the first 2 laps, then I cruised 2 laps, then I had to try and drop him on the last 2 laps.  I ended up closing the last 800 in about 2:05/6 or so and was able to drop him with a 59 last lap. 

It was a really good workout and I'm surprised how easy it felt.  I'm really getting in good shape and my confidence is pretty good right now.

2nd good workout of the week.  Went better than I had anticipated. It was tough, but it wasn't as tough as I thought it was going to be in the last set.  I really thought I'd have to go pretty hard, but I was able to do it without digging excessively deep.  I was sucking some pretty good wind after the last rep, but I recovered pretty quickly and could have done some more a few minutes later.

Huge thanks to DB for jumping into the workout every other quarter and helping me out.  That was a huge benefit to have someone with whom to run half of the workout.

Wish today would have gone better.  Legs just didn't feel springy and light, like they felt last week.  Coach cut the last interval off because he said I wasn't looking too great. 

It may have been because the workout was pretty tough.  Looking at it now, it is pretty quick, despite having decent amounts of rest.

Additionally, the workouts I ran last week were in much more favorable conditions, whereas today was hotter and had a wind on the backstretch (wind--what's new?).

There is a fear creeping into my mind that I didn't pay enough attention to rest and sleep last week, which is why I haven't felt so great thus far this week, but I'm trying to dismiss that and be more confident about this weekend.  If I can feel like I did last week, I'll be in great shape for the race on Saturday."

2nd in the first heat, 4th overall.  On to Des Moines for my first NCAA Track Championship!  

Went out extremely slow during the first 800.  Then Dan Chenoweth from Harvard took over pacing duties and led for the next 8 laps.  After 5 or 6 laps, I moved into 4th and just sat there until with 2 laps to go when a bunch of guys went wide and passed on the outside.  I swung wide to go with that group and moved just fine with them.  Going into the last lap, I had been conserving energy pretty well, so I moved into the lead at the bell to not get caught up in everything.  I was running comfortably hard, but not all out.  With 250 to go, Hill passed me, and then with 150 to go, 3 more guys went around me on the turn and I couldn't respond because I was trapped on the rail.  Luckily there was a gap after those three and I moved to the outside once we hit the homestretch and kicked (fairly comfortably) into 2nd and then just stayed there once I knew I was in.

Legs still didn't feel very good during the race, but I guess good enough to move onto the next round.  Need to really focus on sleep and rest these next two weeks to get some pop and bounce back into my legs."

Felt ok during the first part of the workout.  It was pretty hot out (~90 or so) and under the sun.  The first 1600 and then the 600s certainly didn't feel as easy as they should have.  Then the first 2 of the 400s didn't feel so great either, but then I finally found some rhythm and maybe even, I dare say, a little pop in my stride and finished the last 3 400s feeling pretty decent.  Definitely felt the strongest on the last 400.

06/11/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Race,6.10,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"NCAA Championships - 1:21pm

Race went out quick and I went right to the back and was in last for the entire first mile.  I kept telling myself to hold on, be patient, and people will fall off because there was no way that everyone in the race was going to run in the 13:30s.  Finally after the first mile, I moved up into 22nd and stayed there for the next 3 laps.  Then people really started to fall off the train and on each lap, I steadily moved myself up from person to person, drafting on the backstretch where there was a headwind, and passing on the homestretch.  

Due to the fast pace, it took the sting out of my kick and I couldn't catch up to Hubers or Cabral, which I really would have liked, but I did end up putting 4 seconds on Nick Kipruto from New Mexico in the last 250.

It was a great race for me.  Each lap I was thanking God for my gifts.  I had been thinking all week about how I wanted to make the race sort of a worship experience to thank Him, and it turned out amazingly well. I've never felt so blessed before just to be out there competing.  

Time to take some time off and then get back into it! 5th Year Super Senior!

Forced myself to bed earlier last night so I could try and beat the heat a little more this morning. Well, I certainly beat the heat, but I couldn't escape the humidity. It was just terrible. I did luck out with the weather though because there was cloud cover and it kept the sun from beating down on me.

First 6 miles I felt like junk and I questioned whether I would finish (especially the first 4 where I averaged 7:25 or so), but then I felt much better after I hit 9 miles or so and got in a rhythm. The last 3 miles I averaged 6:30 and came cruising in with a serious need for some water.

Had to run late since I didn't get back from the bachelor party I was at all weekend until 8pm.  Legs surprisingly felt good.  Running once the sun down definitely helped since it was a hot one today.  Did a good job of keeping hydrated during the day, so the run went by much easier than anticipated.  

Also did this run old-school style: sans garmin (suck it DB).  It was out of battery, so I just ran by effort and then mapped it out later.

This morning was rough.  Finishing the long run so late last night, then staying up to eat and hang out with Tommy one last time before he moved to Las Vegas took its toll.  It was really hard getting up and getting moving.  Felt like I had absolutely no power in my stride.

Skipped K-Mack in favor of an additional hour of sleep (5 hours instead of 4)."

Juice, Beckmann, Westfall, Colonel Sanders, and myself.  Felt pretty good--better than anticipated.  Chest hurt decently bad though since I was all stitched up from the surgery this morning. Hurt from all the jostling while running. 

Felt pretty good for the first 4, but then started to feel it on the 5th.  Was probably going a little quicker than comfortable pace.  Need to get myself some proper sleep and be patient and the workouts will come."

Legs were a little tired from the workout yesterday and I think I'm still feeling the lingering effects of the lack of sleep on Sunday night.  

Also skipped out on K-Mack this morning (I know--twice in a week--I'm a slacker...) because my chest was still in some pain and I didn't want all the lifting movements to pull at the stitches and cause more pain or for it to break up the new tissue that was forming.  I feel like that's a somewhat decent excuse.  But still and excuse."

Ran with Book, Beckmann, Westfall, and Sanders.  It was HOT. Really hot. 98� and the heat index was 111�.  That's some hot and humid weather to be doing a tempo in.  Luckily, we moved the tempo to Avoca where it's shaded the whole time.  It didn't end up being too awful.  When I finished though, I simply couldn't stop sweating, so I kept running my head under the murdock there to try and cool off.

Felt pretty good on the tempo portion and debated going a 6th mile, but decided against it and will hopefully be up to the task next week.

Well, I'm an idiot and forgot to set my alarm, so when I woke up at 6:48, I didn't believe my watch.  Then reality set in and I scrambled out of bed, got my run in real quick, and then jet off to work.  Only got there 15 minutes later than normal.  Of course, I had to skip K-Mack though to make it happen. 0 for 3 this week. Weak sauce. Oh well.

I guess the positive side of it is that I got 8.5 hours of sleep instead of 6.5.  Maybe that was God's way of telling me I needed more rest."

Did a long run with the fellas from my parent's house in New Richmond today.  Luckily it cooled off a bit, so it wasn't so bad running today as it was yesterday.  Unluckily, this Cephalexin I've been taking is giving me insomnia or something, as I tossed and turned last night in bed until about 2:30 or 3:00am, so I didn't sleep much and what I got wasn't very high quality.

As a result, the 20 miler I had planned fell through the roof and I struggled through just this 16 miles and then called it quits.  Kind of a bummer, but you win some and you lose some.

Only a couple of days left of this Cephalexin, and then hopefully I'll return to normal."

Pretty tired this morning, but at least I allowed myself to go easy on the run and not push it.  Still trying to get back to running by feel in the mornings instead of being a slave to the watch.  

I tried to counteract the Cephalexin with some sleeping aid pills last night, and I did finally get some quality sleep, but just not enough of it as the sleeping pills didn't kick in until about after 10pm or so.  Then I was just really tired this morning, haha.

Got through the K-Mack routine, but felt like a wuss during it.  Especially on the ab workout part."

Ran with Book, Beckmann, Hauser, and Westfall. Another scorcher, but not as hot as the weatherman anticipated.  It was forecasted to be 110� heat index, but it 'only' ended up being 101�.  It's amazing how much the body gets used to the heat because it really didn't feel all that bad out after so many 105�+ days.

First two miles were a little junky, but then got going on the tempo and I felt really good. I finally feel like I'm getting into the aerobic shape I should be this week. I remember doing stuff like this last summer all the time, but it has taken until the end of July this year to get around to it. But I know it's all due to the late track season and the late start to summer base training.

Anywho, I'm very pleased with this workout and I'm looking forward to extending this type of tempo a few more miles over the next few weeks to really build up some good strength for cross country.  I could have gone another mile during the tempo today without much strain, but I still want to keep things nice and relaxed this early in the training phase.

Mile splits were as follows:

[EDIT]

Ran with RL for the first time this summer! That's right folks--come one and come all--THE one and only Richard Lupp (pronounce 'THE' the way all those C-Bus folk say 'The Ohio State University'--make sure to drag out that 'e').  Man--I will tell you what: running with him is like drinking the elixir of life and brings vigor back to the very depths of my bones.  It's like when you see a rainbow while your running and then find the pot of gold at the end of that beautiful display across the sky--except that Ricky Lupp himself is the leprechaun and he gives out gold to those who are running.  It's like having Adonis DNA or tiger blood when you're running with this guy.  I could have easily crushed this 20 miler had he gone with me the whole way, but he had to tend to his pot of gold.

[/EDIT]

Another failed 20 mile attempt.  Bummer.

Slept in after staying up until 4:00 after the wedding having a good time. Decided I needed the sleep more than just trying to run tired.  It was good that I got the sleep, but by the time I ran, it was over 90� again and the heat index was close to 100�.  For the first 10 miles, it really wasn't that bad, but then I simply couldn't stay hydrated, no matter how many water fountains I stopped at.

Coming back up Ravine, I took the back stairs and couldn't even walk to the top because I was so tired and getting dizzy.  I stopped halfway and sat for a few minutes, then got to the top and sat for a few more minutes before trudging my way back to the house.

At that point, there was no benefit to plowing through another 1.5 miles, so I called it quits.

Kind of disappointing to not get in the long runs that I want to be, but I guess that's what I get for wanting to have a social life too when my friends get married."

Switched things up a bit today with the 3x2 mile instead of the usual mile repeats.  Felt better than I had anticipated (since I've been feeling like junk from my long run), but I think I may have finally recovered from that and the body was willing to go hard.

It rained.  It finally rained. 17 consecutive days of 90�+ and it finally rained this morning.  It was fantastic.  

I almost got struck by lightning in Bellevue Park though.  The sky flashed and I heard an ear shattering crack of thunder almost immediately. I'm pretty sure that the lightning struck within 400 meters of where I was.  That kinda freaked me out and I dodged under the shelter for a few minutes until the storm passed a bit and then continued my run.

Felt good on the run and during K-Mack.  I think it was mainly just because it rained and was cooler."

Tempo with the fellas (Beckmann, Book, Westfall, Sanders, and Griffiths).  Great workout today.  My longest tempo ever (7 miles) and one of my quicker ones.  I'm planning on keeping this kind of stuff up to build up more strength for XC.  I feel that's one of the things I've always lacked in XC and why I'm a little better on the track (relatively). I have more natural speed, which helps when I'm just running shorter and flat, but I don't do as well when my aerobic system is seriously stressed (XC).

Either way, a very good workout and Book went the first 5 with me, which really helped.  Here are the splits:

Did most of this run on the trails, which weren't really all that great.  Rocky, hilly, but there were some decently flat spots that were a bit of a saving grace.  Jumped on the roads whenever my legs needed a quick breather and then I would jump back into the woods once I relaxed again. 

Good run and I'm surprised this went so well. I shouldn't be, but I am since the last 2 attempts at long runs were pretty bad.  Just ran for time back in the woods since there was no way the Garmin was going to be picking up signal.  This ended up being my longest run ever on time."

Turned out to be feeling pretty good after the 3rd one, so I went for another.  Was feeling it a bit in the legs and went a bit out of my comfort zone on the 2nd mile of the last repeat, but other than that, a solid aerobic workout.

I should have eaten a clif bar before I left work, but I forgot to, so my stomach was just tying up from not having anything in it. That unfortunately took away from the joy of the workout and how good my legs actually felt.

Felt good the whole time and had to keep slowing down (especially on the hills) for my brother and Manny.  For the most part though, it was a leisurely pace and all.  It wasn't a race anyway.

Got to mile 62 when we stopped for lunch, and as I was pulling off the road into a park, I ran over a rock that gave me a flat. Went to change it and when I replaced the tube and pumped it up, I realized there was a hole in my tire as well, which sucked. So some guy gave me a tire boot to patch it up and then I was set.  I was a little weary of the tube bursting again though. 

After lunch my brother and Manny were feeling pretty beat and wanted to just do the 10 miles back home instead of the 30 mile loop and then the 10 miles back home.  Kind of a bummer because I really wanted to get in a full century, but I didn't oppose them because I didn't want to risk having my tire blow out really far from where we started.

For the last 10 miles, I took the lead and we averaged right about 20mph, so we were moving at a pretty good clip--especially considering that it was on rolling hills and all.

Great morning and it was awesome riding with my brother!"

Rough getting up and getting moving this morning just because I got back from Pittsburgh so late last night.  Decided against doing K-Mack and opted for the extra hour of sleep.

Surprisingly, legs were not sore at all from the ride yesterday.  For the first mile, my stride felt a little short, but other than that, great morning run and legs felt fresh."

Cut from work early today to go to run from Hauser's and then go to the Western and Southern Tennis match after our run. The bike ride finally caught up to me this run.  I wasn't sore still, but I just had all the energy and pop sapped out of my legs.  They felt really sluggish for the first 5 miles, and then improved their status to just pretty sluggish.

Tennis match was awesome to see.  Roddick acted like a little school girl in the 3rd set though."

Rough morning.  Didn't get back from the tennis match until 12:15, so another late night and another night without much sleep.  I think I've gotten a total of 18 hours of sleep the last 3 nights combined.  And with the training that I've been doing, that's simply not enough.  Legs felt ok on the run.  Just tired.

Need more sleep."

Big group today--it was pretty awesome.  

I was exhausted all day because a full nights rest still eludes me.  I fell asleep in the car over to Winton Woods (Westfall was driving--no worries) and it's only like a 12 min drive.

Weird though because I had one of the best workouts I've ever had at Winton Woods today.  I think it was because I was just overall tired, but my legs actually felt pretty decent.  I would say that I probably pushed a little too much, especially on the end where I like to get progressively faster from a mental standpoint.

Good workout and now I just need some sleep."

Wore the Kinvaras for the first time this morning and they felt awesome.  I'm looking forward to continuing my morning runs with this shoe. I especially like the low heel to toe drop spec, as it allows for a more natural mid-foot strike.

Legs felt so-so.  I just need more sleep.  What's new?"

Tempo run with the fellas.  Good weather for it, legs didn't feel the greatest.  Not bad, but just not quite what they were last week.  Ran the last 5.5 miles of the tempo alone and tried my best to maintain consistent pace, intentionally dropping down on the last mile.

Here are the mile splits:
6:57, 6:57, 5:41, 5:27, 5:22, 5:26, 5:22, 5:18, 5:19, 5:13, 6:38"

Had a 'half-day' Friday, but really I worked an extra hour, then sat in the Social Security Office for another hour, and then sat on the highway in traffic for another hour.  So my half day Friday wasn't so much of a half day.  It was rather disappointing.

Legs felt decent.  Excited to head down to the Red to do some camping this weekend."

Ran with Book, Barry, and Beckmann.  Take this run with a grain of salt--I really have no clue what the distance was, but we did run for a long time. The first 0.75 miles went up like 400 feet.  It was so hard.  We had to stop and walk up some of the precarious stairs that were fudged into the stone in the side of the hill.

Finally the route flattened out and we dodged throughout the woods and clambered over boulders for about 2 hours.  After popping out of the trail, I added on another 28 minutes with an out and back on the road.

Our legs were all torn up from thorn bushes and stinging nettles."

Easy run with Beckmann, Book, and Benner.  Felt like we were going way faster than this, but apparently we weren't.  Legs are tired from the backpacking this weekend down at the Gorge, but it was definitely worth it.

Mile repeats.  Gettin' it done son.  

Felt pretty decent, but perhaps a bit sluggish in the legs.  I'm thinking it's because I ran this in the Fastwitch and not the Streaks, since the Streaks should have been in the grave about 3 months ago.  I'm waiting on the A4's to come in and give them a go.

Book led on 4 of the first 6, and rocketed a 4:45 on the 6th one.  He looked awesome today.  Beckmann also had a great workout and led #5.

Saw DB and Ali this morning.  Going to bed.  While I was starting my day.  Woohoo.

Legs surprisingly didn't feel all that bad and rolling out my left hip last night before I went to bed was a really good thing as it wasn't sore this morning for the first time in 2 Wednesdays (post Winton Woods).  

Need to get me some more sleep.  Looking forward to XC camp next week to catch up."

Pretty good crew today.  Legs felt awesome and it cooled off a bit after a warmer afternoon.  It was one of my best workouts thus far this summer.  Felt smooth, relaxed, and breathing was light.  Went the first 6 with Book and then tacked on another 3 miles of tempo alone.  My longest tempo ever and it felt great.

Pretty good sized crew again today.  Was only planning on going 12, but then was feeling really good, so I decided to get in my long run today instead of trying to squeeze it in tomorrow while watching my brother compete in an Ironman in Louisville.  

Wore the Kinvaras and they just felt awesome the whole time.  I thought that my feet might get a little sore, but I felt so smooth and light in them.  Those are some really good shoes.

Stopped on the side of the road on the way home from rafting and did another progression run.  Coach wanted us to string out the team to try and get a better sense of which freshman should make the team.  Well, it ended up being mostly downhill for the first 8 miles, so everyone kept up when we were going 6 min pace, so I hammered the last mile in 5:14 in the last big uphill of the course, and it strung everyone out, but it was mostly a sprint to the finish. So, unfortunately, it really didn't tell us anything much about the freshman. Sort of a waste of a workout I guess.

After 8, the freshman dropped off and the ol' men kept going another 3 miles at a real easy pace, as we were all exhausted from rafting early in the day."

Legs are definitely feeling the quality of the past 2 days and were sluggish to get going.  I finally got a chance to take a nap today though, which was super refreshing.

Got moving early and the first 2 miles were flat, and then the rest of the run was a gradual uphill climb.  The plan was to move along quickly for the first 5 miles, then do tempo-swing-tempo on the end.  We strung out everyone real fast pretty early, so the swing mile was made a rest mile for the group up front, and then we tempo-ed again for the last mile.

Really a nice course and a great place for a good solid workout.  Mile splits:

09/02/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Race,10.00,miles,3600,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Course was rolling hills and very uneven ground.  It was hot out and there was hardly any shade.  Got to moving pretty well during the race, but my legs were definitely tired from the past 3 days of tempo runs.  

Book had a 20 second lead on me when I started my leg, and I think I ended up putting 9 seconds on him.  Then on the second go-round, he had 25 seconds on me and I put 9 on him.  It was a good challenge to have him in front of me and have to chase him down.  He ran really well and is going to have a good season.

We easily won the team title, as we went 1-2-3 for 6 total points (it was scored on the top three pairs from each team).

Team Lewisburg came 2nd to Team Greenbrier.  I think our course was longer, but maybe it's just because I'm a sore and salty loser.

We skipped going to Kate's Mountain today (which was supposed to be the best run at camp) because of a rainstorm that would have turned the dirt road into a mudpit.  So we just ran on the GRT.  Legs were tired and I didn't feel recovered at all from all we have done the past 4 days."

This might be the earliest I have ever done a long run.  We had to get up and get it done before heading out, and all of us had stayed up late the last night at camp, so it made for a very strange morning run.  We were all tired after only 4.5 hours of sleep and we ran the first hour with a headlamp on the trail because we couldn't see anything.

The first two miles were really slow (9:16, 8:04), but then we eventually picked it up.  The other fellas dropped off at 14 and I added on the last 6 alone cruising along at 6:30 pace.  Legs were really tired and sore, but how they felt wasn't going to change whether I did 16 or 20, so I just went for the full long run.

Another workout at Cindy Cassell's house.  This year we did ~1350 meters or so because we couldn't complete the loop due to the bison gate being open where we usually squeeze through.

Hilly and really uneven terrain made for a pretty tough workout.  6 & 7 were quick because those were the last 2 for the other guys.  I added on 8 & 9 alone and had a hard time getting motivated on the bigger hills on the course.

Definitely in good aerobic shape right now.  Could recover from the intervals very quickly, but just didn't have the specific muscular fitness to hit the hills hard and accelerate.  

Exactly where I want to be and I'm very pleased with my current fitness.

A little shorter this morning due to the Queen City invite this afternoon.  Mileage is still high and my legs are a little tired from training still, but it's early in the season and just training through so that I run well at the end of the season.

I should have a pretty good challenge from Soufiane Bouchiki of Eastern Kentucky today--I've never beaten him on grass before (he beat me at both Pre-Nats and NCAAs last year by a small margin), but he's never beaten me on the track before.

A moderate effort during the race today.  Wanted to keep Book with me for as long as it seemed fit and I was really happy to see him cruise along 2 miles with me.  We pulled away from the competition shortly after the mile on a gradual uphill.

At 2 miles, I picked it up a bit more and pulled away for the win, while Book hung tight and finished 2nd only 6 seconds behind me.  Then Fink (5th), Griffiths (9th), and Beckmann (10th) rounded out our top 5 for a 1-5 spread of 32 seconds.

Very excited about our team depth this year, as our 1-7 spread was 51 seconds, and 1-9 was 55 seconds.

Legs were decently tired during the 3rd mile--I think I'm still feeling the effects of camp and haven't quite fully recovered.  Just feeling tired overall.  

Eastern Kentucky's Men never showed up--only their women.  So it ended up being a nice team confidence booster for us today."

Coach only had on the schedule to tempo 5&6, but I wanted to get in some more quality than that, so I ended up swinging from 1.5 through 4, then tempo 5-8.1 (5k), and then cool down the last 1.4 miles.  

Ran with Juice with the exception of the last 2.5 miles, where he chilled a bit after 2 miles of tempo and I went another mile.  He looked great today. 

It was a perfect day for a workout out on the hills, as it was overcast and a little cool.  Made for a fantastic run and I felt great the whole time.  The short tempo was really easy mentally to do compared to the longer tempos I have been doing.  

Here are the splits:

6:49, 6:29, 5:40, 5:35, 5:33, 5:04, 5:01, 4:53, 6:12, and some change

For the 5k tempo, I hit 15:35 and felt pretty good. The course was an overall gradual downhill for that part (some rolling uphills in there), but it felt smooth and it was nice to get in some real good quality there.  

Very pleased with the workout today.  Looking forward to Vandy."

Individually, the race went pretty well.  I couldn't shake Kemei from Alabama earlier on the hills, even when trying to fartlek a bit. He just maintained pace right on my shoulder and shadowed my every move.  I was getting a bit worried that he was going to be able to outdo me at the end, but when we got to the last mile, I was still feeling pretty good and knew that I could take it given his heavy breathing.

Anyway, had a really good workout today.  This week of workouts is pretty crucial to late season success, so I wanted to hit this workout pretty well and get into the anaerobic threshold.

Cruised feeling pretty good on the mile repeats and only felt it the last 2 repeats.  Other than that, it was under control and feeling good.  

Did the back half of the course for the 500s (give or take--I'm guessing at the distance).  I started at the intersection, ran hard until the top of the back hill, and then jogged the rest of the loop back to the start. Was definitely in anaerobic state on these repeats, but I didn't drop too much into oxygen debt and was able to recover well between them.

Great workout today and it was capped off by seeing the one and only Bill Keckeis after I finished!  He was stopping by to do his own mile repeats for the day.  Great seeing that guy."

So I started off a little quicker thinking that I would just catch up to them, but by 2 miles in, I still didn't see them.  At that point, I was feeling pretty good anyway, so I just kept up about 6 min pace and turned it into a high steady state run.

Come to find out, they actually had started behind me and left from Gettler, which is why I didn't see them.  So I bumped into them on my way back from XU while they were heading over there.

Got up and got moving.  Legs were a little stiff for the first mile, but then loosened up quite nicely.  I feel pretty recovered from yesterday's race. Back to no fun zone with crazy amounts of school work to do.  

Did K-Mack and felt pretty good."

Needed to get in an early double due to classwork and project meetings.  Legs felt pretty good and I just hummed along.  Definitely speculating about Big East in two weeks about what I can do."
10/18/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.30,miles,2251,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard Plus - 7:00am

Legs felt pretty good despite only 5.5 hours of sleep.  I just need to make it through this week and then I think schoolwork will let up a bit.

Need to manage my time efficiently so I can get more sleep, especially next week for Big East."

Another Kenyan double today due to class conflict.  I just need to make it through this week and then I can sleep.

Anyway, got in a really solid effort today and I'm extremely pleased with my fitness right now.  I've finally come to the conclusion that I think Terre Haute is a slow course due to the bad footing and long grass.  It's not hilly, but it's always hard to race there.  I feel this way this because I did a 5 mile tempo in 25:14 today two days after the race and it was way easier, due to the flat ground.  

In either case, 2 mile w/u, 5 mile tempo, 3.5 mile c/d.  Tempo splits are as follows:
5:10, 5:05, 5:05, 5:01, 4:53"
10/19/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.30,miles,2206,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard Plus - 6:00am

Colder and sprinkling out this morning.  Legs were a little sluggish, but felt alright overall.

Blasted through K-Mack before hitting the homestretch (hopefully) of my No-Fun-Week.  Only 1 more presentation to go."

What an absolutely nasty day.  About 40 degrees, raining, windy, and just nasty.

Threw on the new patagonia rain jacket for the run though and it was awesome.

Anyway, legs felt pretty decent."

It's been raining in Cincinnati for about 36 hours now.  Still just dreadful out.  Legs were a little sluggish this morning."

Ran this workout after class with Baum.  Still raining and nasty in Cincinnati. Unreal--just so unpleasant out.

Workout went really well.  Instead of the original plan of going to Salway Park, Coach decided just to do it in Nippert since going to Salway would have made for a 14 mile workout and that was too much.

In either case, I was able to get in a good solid effort, having to dig deep at times, but not going all out.  It was a really good workout for this point in the season.  Baum ran awesome too.

Looking forward to Big East!"
10/21/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.30,miles,2212,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard Plus - 6:20am

Didn't get near the amount of sleep I wanted to, thanks to the Sigma Simga fellas, but I'll get to nap this afternoon.

Met up with Baum and did the K-Mack.  We were both pretty tired, but got through it just fine.  It was nice having a partner for the first time in a while."

Easy run with the fellas.  Legs weren't feeling the greatest, but it was just a nice recovery run.  It finally stopped raining in Cincinnati. Miracle."
10/22/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.10,miles,3686,,,Fastwitch,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Hyde Park - Grandin - 10:12am

Slept in today and it felt awesome.  Took my time getting ready and got a cup of joe and then headed out the door.  Wanted to throw in a bit of quality today, so I swung miles 3 and 5, then tempo on miles 7 and 9.  Felt decent, but not great.  The swing miles went really well and I felt real smooth, but then I had trouble getting into the tempo zone. A bit sluggish on the first tempo and then felt better on the second one.  

Just need to watch my sleep and make sure I'm getting needed rest and I should be ready to go next weekend.  Definitely excited about it.

Splits were as follows:
6:56, 6:22, 5:38, 6:19, 5:44, 6:25, 5:14, 6:28, 5:03, 6:26"

Easy long run with Fink.  Legs didn't feel as good as I would have liked.  Need to pay attention to my sleeping and eating habits this next week extra carefully to make sure I'm recovering well.

The 20 milers are over for the season and now it's time to enter a slight taper towards NCAAs.

10/24/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.30,miles,2200,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard Plus - 7:00am

Not as easy as I thought it would be getting up, but once I got moving I felt pretty good.  Worked on some of that Good Form Running stuff from the seminar/class thing yesterday.  Pretty interesting stuff.

Anyway, blasted through K-Mack pretty quick and then got back home to kick off the week."
10/24/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,9.60,miles,4110,,,A4,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Eden Park - 3:47pm

Good workout with the fellas today.  Wanted to get in something faster and hard, but not too tiring.  I think we accomplished this pretty well and I'm thinking that my effort levels for the 665s are going to pay off come NCAAs.  

Still feel like 'middle of the season' shape and not quite sharp--exactly where I want to be.  

I'm very pleased with my progression this fall.  Just need to make sure I'm getting enough sleep this next month."
10/25/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.30,miles,2156,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard Plus - 7:00am

Another day in the books.  Moved a little quicker than I thought I would this morning.  Working on that 180 bpm stuff.  Need to get more comfortable with it.

Legs felt good."

Nice easy run alone before starting the long trek of afternoon/evening classes.  What a beautiful day for a run! It was just gorgeous outside and I was just cruising along and my legs felt great.  Had to keep telling myself to slow down and take it easy.  

Definitely getting into some good shape and looking forward to NCAAs!"
10/26/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.30,miles,2134,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard Plus - 7:00am

Felt amazing out this morning--it was in the low 60s and just perfect for a shirtless morning run.  

Legs felt really good this morning and I just glided along. K-Mack went by real fast. All of this paying attention to getting proper rest is paying off.  Makes me wonder what I could do if I slept enough every night.  Maybe next year after I finish school."
10/26/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,8.10,miles,3163,,,Mirage,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Front of SGC - Bellevue - 4:11pm

Easy run with the fellas with a mile tempo on Spring Grove. Another really nice day for running considering the weather.  Legs felt awesome and I felt so relaxed on the tempo.  Cranked out a 4:32 mile and it felt smooth and easy.  Legs are really coming along well."
10/27/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.30,miles,2126,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard Plus - 7:00am

Started out a little stiff, but then moved into a good pace pretty quick.  Legs are feeling good.  Final run in the Kinvara's today.  Need to retire this pair and move onto the next pair.  What a great pair of shoes."

Finally won myself a Big East XC title! Today was the perfect day for it and everything worked out so well.  I really feel like it's just another piece of the puzzle that fits into this whole season.  And the best part is that I didn't have to go to the well for the win--it was honestly an easier race than Pre-Nats.  

Definitely pleased with today.  Has me contemplating a little more about what I might be able to do at NCAAs.

The big bummer of the day was that our team ran pretty poorly and coach just blew up on us after the race (we were 8th and lost to Marquette).  I haven't ever seen a rant like that before from him.  It was pretty bad.  

Learn to live another day.  Keep your heads high fellas--we'll turn it around at the Regional."
10/30/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,17.00,miles,6830,,,Kinvara,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ault Park - Brotherton - 8:08am

Ran with Skeet Minduski this morning! It was awesome having him as company on the run.  Legs actually felt really good and quite recovered from the race yesterday.  We settled into a pretty good clip and just went with it.  Beautiful morning for a run."
10/31/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.30,miles,2175,,,Kinvara,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard Plus - 7:00am

Easy run in a bit of a chilly sprinkle.  Legs felt good and I'm feeling pretty recovered from the race on Saturday.  Keep plugging along and focus on NCAAs.

K-Mack flew by with Baum, Moscato, and Griffiths in the Armory as well."
10/31/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.70,miles,2662,,,Mirage,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Front of Spring Grove - 4:20pm

Easy run with the team, branched off from them and they did back of SGC while I only did front.  Planning on doing a tempo tomorrow, which is longer than what coach has on the schedule and I'm trying to keep an eye on my miles this week, so a nice easy run for me today.  Legs felt good and dang--running less than 7 miles in the afternoon feels like I barely ran at all."
11/01/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.30,miles,2197,,,Kinvara,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard Plus - 7:00am

Had a rough time waking up this morning--not sure why.  Guess I just need to keep making sure that I'm getting to bed a little earlier and not wasting time at night.  

Legs felt mediocre.  Not bad, but just not what they were last week.  Which is fine, since this week is supposed to be more of a training week and they shouldn't be feeling good again for another 2 weeks from now."
11/01/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.40,miles,3663,,,Fastwitch,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Vine - CP - Ludlow - Spring Grove - Clifton - SSI - 11:19am

Wanted to get another solid tempo effort today on the same course that I ran two weeks ago.  Ended up being a very good effort and I turned out a pretty good tempo. It was moderately difficult, but I just hung in there and tried to stay relaxed.  Looking to really get some rest and recover well from this, as it will be crucial for the effort to pay off.

Tempo from the intersection of Vine and CP down to the creepy bar on Spring Grove.  5 miles in 24:29 (4:54/mi).  Mile splits as follows:

4:55, 4:54, 4:52, 4:55, 4:50"
11/02/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.30,miles,2182,,,Kinvara,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard Plus - 6:00am

Got moving a little earlier today as I have quite a number of things to do before classes get rolling today.  

Body was definitely feeling the effort from the tempo yesterday, so I eased into the run.  Felt somewhat lackadaisical during the K-Mack routine, but powered through it.  Helped that Baum was in there doing it at the same time."
11/02/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.60,miles,2727,,,Mirage,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"EPO - MLK - 4:13pm

I think this might be a Sheakley Standard Plus record for me.  I didn't feel like I was going any harder, but I guess I moved along pretty quick.  I could tell that my legs are still feeling the workout from Tuesday a bit as well."
11/03/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,11.40,miles,4028,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Igloi Workout - Nippert Stadium - 11:30am

Tough workout today.  My legs were still feeling the tempo from Tuesday, so I didn't feel nearly as snappy as I had anticipated my legs to feel.  I went harder today, but made sure not to break the bank because I know I'm getting to that point in the season where things should be getting faster and easier.  With some extra rest the next few days (I'll be going much shorter in the afternoon), I think this workout will pay off nicely.  I just need to make sure I have the nutrition to allow my body to recover from this effort.

Other than that, if I do the right things to recover, this week should pay off real nicely come NCAAs."
11/04/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.30,miles,2181,,,Kinvara,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Sheakley Standard Plus - 7:00am

Easy morning run.  Legs were feeling the workout from yesterday and were rather stiff the first mile.  Then I loosened up and felt better, but I was just tired overall.  Perhaps still not enough sleep (~7.5 hours/night all week just isn't cutting it).  

Since my body was not feeling up to it, I decided to skip the majority of the K-Mack routine and just did the hurdle section to try and loosen up my legs and bust the junk out of them. I think it helped."
11/04/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.40,miles,2230,,,Mirage,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Bellevue - Fairview Park - Fairview Avenue - Warner - Bellevue - 4:06

Short easy run with the fellas today.  Legs are definitely feeling the effects of the two workouts this week.  Need to get some extra rest to recover properly."
11/05/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,5.70,miles,2356,,,Mirage,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Mt. Storm - 8:12am

Easy run alone.  Might be the shortest I've gone in a single day in 2 or 3 months.  I'll have to look that up. [After looking it up, it's been over 3 months since I've gone that short in a single day.]

Legs were tired and feeling pretty sluggish from the week.  Hopefully this easy day (almost an off day) will help them recover and I'll be back to normal soon with some extra sleep."
11/06/2011,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,16.00,miles,6271,,,Kinvara,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Ault Park - Bellevue - 8:05am

Nice easy long run alone this morning. And legs are back to feeling good! A couple of easy runs and some extra sleep will do some wonders.  I was just cruising along this morning and had to keep telling myself to slow down.  

Man, it's good to be in shape.  Just focusing on NCAAs."

Headed down to Eden Park to do 3x665 at good effort and then added on coming back to get some mileage.  Legs didn't have much pop today--wish they would have had more spring in them during the laps around the fountain down at Eden Park.  

Just didn't have a nice spring to my step today, so I'm going to make a conscious effort to take it easy the next few days to make sure I'm fresh for Saturday."

Easy morning run.  It was just straight up dreary outside.  Misting and overcast the whole run.  A little chilly, but not too bad.  Legs felt good and I made a concerted effort to go easier/slower today.

Decided against the full K-Mack routine in favor of just doing the hurdle section to give my legs some more rest.  That, and I have to try to crank out a lab report before 11am."

It's really hard to let a guy go when you know you can beat him, but I'm trusting that was the smart move to make so that I'm more rested come NCAAs.  I just have to trust in myself.

Other than that, a good race and absolutely beautiful weather.  

Team placed 11th, only 1 point behind Purdue.  The team tried to blame it on me, but we would have lost in a tiebreaker anyway, bummer.  It was kinda funny though because Coach was really getting a good laugh out of it.

Overall, I'm feeling pretty good about this race.  I can honestly say that I gave 100% and had nothing left at the end.  On the other hand, I was really shooting to be top 20, but I guess that just wasn't in the cards today.  Had I been able to move with a few guys at the 8k mark, I could have done it, but my legs didn't want to respond and they pulled away from me.

Mentally, I was at ease before the race and confident in my ability.  Much better mental preparation than last year.  I'm getting better at handling the challenges at bigger races.

Need to put in some more work into building aerobic strength.  I think that would have been the difference maker--especially at 8k when I had trouble holding pace.  Hopefully I can keep putting in longer tempos during the winter between indoor races to keep working on that strength.  For the most part, the speed is there for the 5k."

Went to go run on Sheakley, but it was a solid sheet of ice, so I had to settle for campus loop.

About a mile in, I was just cruising along fine with no pain, pronating normally, and everything was good and chipper. I even thought about going to Mt. Storm because I was feeling so good, but I decided to be cautious and not overdo it.

So I just kept trucking back to the SSI when my 3rd tarsal in my left foot really started bothering me. And it was a decently sharp pain. Wouldn't go away. 

If it's not my toe, and not my arch, I guess it has to be something??"

Went to go for an easy run just to see how the foot was doing. Started hurting about 200 meters in, but I needed to see what was going to happen to the pain. So I kept going and the pain just kept getting worse in the 3rd tarsal of my left foot. When I finished, it was a pretty sharp pain.

After getting home and taking off the shoes, I'm now limping around because the pain is so sharp. Stress fracture? Maybe? Where in the world did that come from?

This is extremely frustrating. Now I can't even jump on the elliptical later because simply having pressure on my foot bothers it.

Talked to the doc today and received GREAT news. No stress fracture, not even a hint of one. Doc said that i just had some ridiculous swelling and inflammation in the muscle inertion points to the metatarsals. 

He prescribed some stronger steroids to take and another round of PT/iontophoresis.

His exact words were, 'We're gonna blast the hell out of this thing with steroids.'

God is good. Real good. 

I have this scripture of the day widget on my phone, and it was so fitting that yesterday it had the following verse displayed:

 �Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD 
And whose trust is the LORD. 
 For he will be like a tree planted by the water, 
That extends its roots by a stream 
And will not fear when the heat comes; 
But its leaves will be green, 
And it will not be anxious in a year of drought 
Nor cease to yield fruit.'

17.8 miles in 1:25 in rec.

Had some company for the 2nd half of the session, which made it go by a lot faster.  That was nice catching up with Brock.

Went to PT following the workout and talked to Andrew about going back to getting in the pool instead of the elliptical.  I feel like I'm still getting better, but my progressed has slowed.  He suggested doing some more deep water running stuff instead to switch it up, but do it in shallower water where I can still have some impact to stimulate healing.

I'm headed in later today so he can show me some pool plyos he wants me to do.  I guess we'll give this a shot and see if it helps me get better faster."

Andrew wanted to try doing some light impact water plyo stuff in the therapy pool, so he told me to do 10 mins of high knees against the jets in 4ft of water, then 100 stair steps, then 100 one-legged bounds on each foot.

Well, the chlorine levels in the pool were all messed up today and the stuff was so potent that I could breath heavy without coughing.  I almost threw up 3 times while doing the high knee stuff.

I suffered through some of the stair steps, but then I had to call it a day and get out of the pool room because the chlorine levels were so high.

It was pretty disappointing to try something new and have it turn out so badly the first time around.

Afterwards, I went and did my ab/pushup routine in the weightroom and just called it a day.  Frustrated."

Did an hour of running back and forth in the 4ft section of the rec pool.  It's not really all that effective at getting my heart rate up.  I can only get it up to about 120 or so and hold it there.

But if some of this light impact loading stuff is hopefully going to help me get back to the real deal, then it's worth it.

During my 'run', I reflected on how things are going for guys indoors.  It's really tough to see a guy that I beat go out and run 3:55.75 for the mile and then get an invite to the Wannamaker mile when I'm just stuck in an aqua jogging routine.  Granted, he has more speed, but I look at the opportunities that he has and it's frustrating to feel like I'm stuck.  Especially when it's my last year and this is when I need to be trying to impress shoe companies to try and score a deal.

It's frustrating, but I have to keep believing that there's a end to the means and that it will work out.  Vision was getting a little blurry today, but hopefully things will clear soon.

Saw a PT who's a foot specialist and I my problem is stemming from my hips, or so she says.  That's what foot specialists always say, 'the problem is in your hips.'  I've been told that by podiatrists ever since I was in high school, 'you're out of alignment.'  Well, that doesn't do me a whole lot of good because I've been out of alignment for the last 8 years then, but I've only had this problem for the last 6 weeks, so what do you want me to do about it?

She put some wedge in my orthotic to try and correct my gait on my left foot since I've been supinating unconsciously to avoid the pain in the first MTP.

Doctor prescribed me no more anti-inflammatories, just these numbing patches to help me deal with the pain in my foot.  

In either case, I was really frustrated after seeing this round of specialists. Went down to the weight room, did 7 mins on the bike, but was sick and tired of it.  So then I threw on a long sleeve shirt, headed out to Nippert and did a lap on the turf.  Foot felt ok, but still hurt.  At the very least, the pain was isolated to the first MTP instead of being all over.

Then I did 2 stadiums in 18:30 since going up and down stairs has little impact and doesn't bother my foot.  That got me breathing pretty good.

Foot actually felt somewhat decent this morning.  Really focused on pushing off the first metatarsal, and only had pain in the first MTP joint, which I see as an improvement.  Again, Doc said that it was ok to run through pain so long as it was in the joint because there's no chance I'm doing any damage.  

Went to see Andrew (PT) afterward and pushed him about being more aggressive to try and get a cortisone shot, since that is apparently a cure with no drawbacks, so long as the doctor can actually hit the joint.  If he misses and hits the tendon, then there are drawbacks.  So I said, 'Get the doc to hit the darn thing--that's his job.' 

Going to see Doc Devine again tomorrow and try to convince him, with Andrew's backing, to get a cortisone shot and just knock this thing out.

First tempo/hard session in about 4 months.  I have mixed feelings.  It went right along with my expectations of wanting to average sub 5:20, but it took a little more effort than anticipated.  I also felt pretty sloppy during it.  I have certainly lost some fast running coordination, but that should come back pretty quickly.

Other than feeling sloppy and not running very smoothly, I really can't be disappointed with this run.  Certainly an indication that I haven't lost too much fitness.  Cardio is in much better shape than my legs.  Breathing was fine, but muscles were limiting factor.

Mixed feelings about this workout.  

First actual track workout since last June I think.  Wanted to hit 4:50s, but that clearly wasn't in the cards today.  Hit it on the first one, but had to work hard to get there.  Tried to do it on the second, and the body just wasn't having it.  Legs are just not in shape.

So on the 3rd, I just relaxed and let it happen.  Ended up just a smidgen over 5 and I kinda figured I would just keep going up from there.  Sort of like a reverse cut-down.  A cut-up, if you will. 

But surprisingly, on the 4th one, I was able to relax, settle in, and was surprised when I saw that I went sub-5.  Did it again on the 5th.  Then on the last one, I was set at 5 minute pace and just closed with a 68.  

So, overall, I can't really be too displeased.  First track workout in a long, long time.  I'm happy that I'm running healthy and back on the track.  

This Friday is going to be tough though.  It's very likely that I'll run my slowest track 5k ever.  If I break 15:00, I will be happy."

Most miserable bike ride of my life.  Started raining 10 miles in and didn't let up for the next 30.  For the last 20 miles I was hypothermic and shivering on the bike.  Add to that my obscured vision because my glasses were getting all fogged up and covered in water, and it was literally awful.

Just staying fit.

Saw Bob Mangine today (head trainer) and I'm not getting a bone scan.  The gist of what's happening is as follows:

1) Use Flector patches 24/7. These are epidermal anti-inflammatory patches.

2) Be either in a boot or a steel shank all the time. Basically he is trying to limit movement of my big toe, which the steel shank will do. It's a steel plate inserted in my shoe to immobilize the toe.

3) No more working out doing anything except pool workouts to eliminate all impact and stress.

4) He wants to try and tape the toe in a week to see if that enables me to run on it.

5) Laser therapy twice a day.

6) Rolling and gripping exercises on the big toe to try and increase the strength.

Finally, he said for Big East in 2 weeks that they could give me another steroid shot to get me through the weekend. After that, they will shut me down completely by immobilizing it as much as possible to get healthy faster."

Last race of my collegiate career.  From dust I came and to dust I return.  That's my collegiate story.  Came in with injury and going out with injury.

It's tough, as it's not the way I had envisioned it after such a breakthrough year and a strong fall.  I had plans.  I'm a very planned and practical individual, and it's tough when I can't follow through on those.  The sub-4 minute mile didn't happen this year.  Sub 7:55 in the 8k, hitting the trials 'A' of 13:33.  It can be pretty disheartening to set these achievable goals only to see them vanish before my eyes this year.

I'm still looking for answers.  I'm still looking for health.

I'm still looking for the meaning of James 1:2-4 in all of this, 'Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.  And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.

What is my lesson during this season of life?

I do want to take a moment and give thanks.  First to my Lord for having showered me with innumerable blessings throughout my collegiate career.  I have achieved much beyond what I could ever imagine when I was a non-running hurt freshman.  He surrounded me with an amazing family of teammates and coaches who supported me through the good times and the bad.  He blessed me with parents who have been incredibly active in support of my running career.  Thanks to my Coach, Bill Schnier, for believing in me and telling me that I could always do more--that I could win.  Expect to win.  Thanks to my teammates, who in their practical jokes and snarky comments have become my brothers and sisters.  Thanks to the entire track team, who lifted me up and shouted my name during the entirety of my last collegiate race, even though it was against all odds that I would win.  They were behind me every step of the way with UC cheers and signs giving me strength.  

It is a race that I will never forget.

On to the next thing.  My best racing days and better health lie ahead of me.  Take one day at a time, give thanks, and give praise."

Foot felt ok during run, but was sore rest of the day.  First MTP and hallicus longus.  

Additionally, I am out of naproxen (as of the beginning of this week), so the pain might be attributed to having run out of that.

Don't want to use it as a crutch to get back though."

Saw Dr. Yost yesterday at Norwood chiropractic.  He specializes in ART and took a look at my foot. He basically concurred with the other diagnostics I've had--that I just have inflammation in my first MTP.  He said there really wasn't a whole lot he could do for me, but he did do a little ART on my flexor hallicus longus.  

Additionally, he did suggest using a different waveform for my electrical stimulation therapy.  Instead of premod, he suggested using microcurrent.

Went into see Rose this morning and she said that I can use the high voltage setting instead and it would produce the same results via residual charge, but could accomplish more in a shorter period of time.

She also gave me some new Feldenkrais movements I can do for my feet, which should hopefully help increase fluid exchange in the joints and reduce the inflammation.

Going into the training room to see if I can push for a second MRI to get some feedback on what's going on in the MTP joint.

I also scheduled an appointment with a well known foot doctor in the area.  I just heard that he's the best guy to go to in Cincinnati if you have a problem below the ankle.  Problem is that the first available appointment isn't until August 1st, but I requested to be put on the cancellation list to see if I can get in sooner. *fingers crossed*"

Also got an MRI this morning on the fly.  Also got it read and here's what's next:

The Good: No more inflammation (!) in the 1st MTP according to the MRI.  Inflammation difference was significant compared to previous MRI in January.

The Bad: still having tendinopathy in the flexor hallicus longus tendon where it meets the 1st MTP. 

The plan: start immediately with ketoprofen, a topical anti-inflammatory.  Apply 3 times a day.  Likely heading in to see see Dr. Colosimo on Thursday to determine if a PRP shot would be appropriate in that location."

Had a good talk with Bob today in the training room.  Here's the plan:

See Colosimo on Tuesday (7/17).  He's going to inject a numbing agent (some variant of novacaine) into my left flexor hallucis longus. If I can walk around following the shot with no pain, it then confirms the MRI report.  

If confirmed, Colosimo will then do a PRP (platelet rich plasma) injection into the tendon.  I can have up to 3 of these shots, each spaced a week apart.  Despite some controversy on the efficacy of PRP, Bob is convinced that it is effective with acute tendon problems (i.e. those from athletics).

I hope we can do the PRP and try something new.  Let the healing begin."

Went to get my injection after the workout.  Man, what an awful organization. Bob was 70 min late to even showing up to the training room, then cussed out just about everybody on the way over to east campus. Then they had some doctor look at me and I asked him if he had been briefed on my injury and he just says, 'Honestly, no, they didn't tell me anything. They just told me, 'Go look at him.'' So then I apologized to him on behalf of UC Sports Medicine and finally in walks Colosimo. He sees me, shakes his head, and spurts out, 'Pain in my ass.' To which I respond, 'Good to see you too.' They do the lidocaine injection, find out the tendon is the issue, argue over whether to do a PRP injection or steroid shot, then finally settle on PRP. Well, turns out that since they nailed me with the numbing agent, we have to wait until Thursday to do the PRP now because the area has to 'be clean.' What a hassle."

My first mile back in a long time.

First half was in about 4:12 and had a little discomfort in my first MTP joint, but I wouldn't call it pain.  No problem with the flexor hallucis longus at all, which I was anticipating, but still excited about.

I picked it up a bit for the second half and surprisingly, the discomfort in the first MTP disappeared. If I had to guess, I think the joint had just been a bit rattled from the bike ride yesterday and that's why I was getting a bit of a response.  Ghost pain?

In either case, I cannot say how much I'm excited to run again, but I haven't let my mind be sold just yet.  Cautiously optimistic."

Easy run with my brother from my grandparent's house on the trail.  Ran the first 4.5 with him and then sped it up a little and finished alone.

Really tough getting up this morning since I went to the later show of bluegrass last night.  But I eventually roused my way out of bed and was plodding on the street. 

Felt like I was running through sand the first half mile but then warmed up alright.  At no point did I ever feel good though.  My left calf was acting up too and gave out a couple of times, but I think it's just sore from being a tad overworked from the last two days.  Going to plan on rolling out a bit this evening after work and it'll be fine."

Easy morning run.  Felt nice out this morning and I ran in Colin's dad back on the Grandin loop, but it was almost pitch black and I didn't recognize him until he replied to my greeting, 'Good morning' in true British accent.  I was then going to say hi, but it was too late by the time I realized it.

Slowly picked it up throughout the run."

Saw one of the backup pitchers for the Red's this morning (knew him from when he used to pitch for UC) delivering packages for UPS.  We both realized we recognized each other as I zipped by him when he was stepping off the truck to deliver a package.  I told him Merry Christmas and was just like, 'Off season job??' and he sort of grinned and nodded.

Sidewalks were pretty icy, so I did most of this on the shoulder of the road.  It was good to get going early, as there weren't many cars to dodge.

Felt like I was straining a bit to keep a steady pace--perhaps it was a little quick, but I wasn't paying attention to it mid-run.

Long run with Lupp around Savannah.  First 2 with Collmar and Ali, then to 4 with Ali, the rest with Lupp.

Ran shirtless on the last day of the year with Lupp on a crushed gravel path and we cruised along, finishing our last mile in 5:40.  It was a great run and great end to a not so great year of running for me.

Not a great run for me today. After spending all day yesterday moving and not eating as much as my body needed, I felt sluggish the whole run. Then about 13 miles I started running out of gas and with a mile to go, my blood sugar just started plummeting.

By the time I finished, I was shaking and light headed. Luckily Luppfontaine had some chocolate milk and honey stingers at his house, so I hit those bad boys up and normalized the body pretty fast.

Made sure I got enough food in me the rest of the day so that I could recover as best I could."

Relaxing easy jaunt around town. Really enjoyed this run. 

I passed a rather larger man who was also running on a skinny sidewalk with no place to get off on either side, so I warned him with 'Excuse me.' He sorta cocked his head sideways as I passed to see me and so I waved and said, 'Good evening.' He grumbled something back, paused for a second, and then mumbled, 'Show off.' 

Took me a couple of steps to realize what he said, and when he did, I really wanted to mouth off back to him. I wish I could say that I bit my tongue, but in reality, there were a flurry of thoughts running through my head and I just couldn't pick one out."

Good run this morning. Still pretty cold out (15� felt like 6�), but not too bad. 

Got in a good KMack this morning and then on my way home, I came up on a car wreck that had just happened and the emergency crews hadn't made it there yet. A jeep was upside down and wrapped around a pole and a Mazda RX8 had been crunched in on the driver's side front. Both vehicles absolutely totaled. 

The drivers and a few other people were off to the side in the grass and I went to go see if they were ok. The guy who was driving the jeep didn't say much and kept trying to get up. We had to keep telling him to stay seated. The girl driving the Mazda was just silently crying holding her shoulder, but seemed mostly just shaken up. Luckily they both seemed ok."

Slept through my alarm this morning, so this ended up being a run after church. It turned out to be a good thing because it warmed up enough to wear shorts and both of us felt much better after being fully awake for the run.

Same thing as last week--6 mile steady state from 9-14 with the following splits:
5:40
5:40
5:34
5:40
5:36
5:33

So a little quicker than last week and it felt pretty good. First 3 miles were pretty easy (assisted by a little downhill action) with the last half a little more taxing on the aerobic system, but not overdoing it.

Bubble - 4:30pm

Wanted to add a high end aerobic workout to remind my legs of a little speed. Very happy about this--first time I've done anything this fast since May 2012 (Big East). 

Went in wanting to keep it relaxed and not push over the LT. Was able to keep the pace up and feel comfortable doing it. By the end, body was not taxed and felt equivalent to a good solid run. 

Looking to do some more of this max aerobic capacity stuff in the next month. Will perhaps be doing some 20 x (1 minute on, 1 minute off), or 10x3min with 35-45 second rest at a high aerobic effort to get the heart rate up.

Most importantly, finished with the foot feeling good and healthy."

Mario was in the Armory too doing hurdle drills this morning and listening to all these motivational talks by Eric Thomas on the speakers.  It was all about how failure is not an option.

He's gearing up for Virginia Beach half and then for Boston, so I jumped in this workout with him.  Was an awesome aerobic challenge and a really good run.  Really pleased with how it turned out.  Felt comfortable the whole time, minus the last few miles where my legs were just feeling the impact from the miles put on the ol' Fastwitch shoes.

Icy out this morning and I had to run on the roads where the salt was.  On the way there, a schoolbus pulled out on the road behind me at around 5:15am.  The road was FOUR lanes wide (one way street), and this schoolbus friggin' tailed me for about 400 meters.  There was NO other traffic.  Dude was just riding me as I ran along.  I turned around and threw my arms up at the driver and he finally took him and his cheesewagon around me.  What the heck!?

Added a new hip strengthening routine today to KMack courtesy of the Oregon Project boys (http://m.runnersworld.com/race-training/oregon-project-stability-routine?cm_mmc=Twitter-_-RT-_-Content-Training-_-OregonProjectStabilityRoutine).  I did Hot Salsa, Runner's Touch, Clamshell, Reverse Clamshell, and the Jane Fonda.  I think the Jane Fonda was the best one for hitting the hips.

On the way back after KMack routine it got a little dodgy because there was more traffic out and I had to keep going back and forth from icy sidewalk death to getting run over on the roads."

Flew out to Phoenix for a work convention and as soon as I got out to the hotel, I took a taxi down to the South Mountains and ran on the Holbert Trail there.  First mile was an easy warmup, and then it got pretty steep for the next two.  Once I got to the top, it leveled out on the National Trail.  It was just a beautiful view... absolutely amazing weather and I was so happy to be running on a trail.  It was pretty technical though and I kept having to slow down and scamper around some rocks and whatnot.  In either case, took it slow on the uphill trying to make sure that I wasn't going deep into oxygen debt--tried to keep it aerobic. (See map of route here: http://connect.garmin.com/activity/278671657)

Once I got to the top, I jumped on the road for an easy grade down for about 5 miles and then ran back to the hotel, which was pancake flat the rest of the way.  Put in 4x10 second surges starting at 15 miles with 2 min between surges.  Was pretty tired when finished.  Made for a good long run.  Did my first ice bath in a really long time following the long run as well.  The ice machine in the hotel made it easy to do.

1.  Foot felt healthy--that's the best part.  It was so much fun to compete again.

2.  This was a big time challenge to my lactate system.  I haven't really challenged my body with anything this sustained and fast in a long time, and I could tell.  I was pretty tired at the end.  I could have had a better kick if challenged, but the last mile pace was close to my maximum effort.

3.  A good thing is that my overall body strength seemed to be in good shape--it was really only my legs getting tired at the end (wasn't struggling with body posture or arm swing).

4.  I need to be able to basically do this back to back to back to back in just under 4 months if I want to run my goal time at the US Half Marathon Championships.  It definitely puts my goal into perspective."

Great workout day.  Was feeling pretty tired after the uphills in Burnet woods, but the easy jog over to the track made my legs snap out of it and I was ready to go for the 200s.  I think running in spikes on the track is like doping.  It just felt so easy clicking off 30s instead of 32-34.

Easy run up to the cross on the hill, back down the road, and then around town a bit.  What a beautiful city nestled between some volcanoes.  

City elevation is at 5000ft, but the altitude didn't bother me.  The pollution really got to me though.  There's all these 'pacayas' (called chicken bus in English, see here: http://images.world66.com/ch/ic/ke/chicken_bus_galleryfull) that just blow out pollution like crazy and there's smog everywhere.

The worst part might be the streets though: they're almost entirely cobblestone within the city, which makes for a hard place to run as your ankles have to work triple overtime to keep you balanced."

Well.  I thought this was going to be an easy run.  And it was, minus the 1,400 ft of elevation gain in 2.5 miles.  

Basically 2.5 miles up, 2.5 miles down.

And then on the way down, I got attacked by a pack of 5 vicious dogs.  As I was coming up on them sleeping, one barked and then BOOM, they all came after me.  I was running downhill right at them, so I leaped over the pack, spun around in the air, and landed shuffling backwards.  I was backing up trying to hold my position around the hairpin turn while they flashed their teeth and flared their nostrils at me.  

Just as I was getting ready to try and kick to defend myself, the owner came out and yelled something incomprehensible at them.  That delayed them long enough for me to dart around the turn and outta sight.  But boy, did that get my heart rate going."

This is the hottest long run I have ever done in March.  By far.  It was probably also the hardest long run I've done in a long time.  

We were going to go to the beach today.  The plan was to leave at 6:45 and have a 2 hour drive to get there.  Fair enough--so I decided to do my long run once we got to the beach.  It was going to be at sea level and have less pollution, and at 8:45, it shouldn't be that warm.

Well, we left on Guatemalan time (we were with a bunch of Guatemalans who only spoke Spanish--it made for a really funny and awesome day), which meant that we didn't leave until 8:00.  And then we had to stop a bunch, so we didn't arrive at the beach until about 11:00. By that time, it was already about 85 with the sun beating down.

I decided to break my run into smaller, more manageable sections and stop back to hydrate between each one.  I started out thinking I'd do 7-7-6.  Well, I finished the first 7 and was already really dehydrated and feeling weak.  I was just not used to this heat at all.  

So then I doused myself with water in the shower, drank a liter of water, and went back out.  This time I thought 'I'll finish my run in sections of 3 miles at a time now.'  

On the second loop, I ran across another guy who is studying to be a doctor in San Fran.  He was surprised that there was someone as crazy as him out there running in the heat (I felt likewise).  He was dehydrated and exhausted as well, so I joined him running back to the hotel to make sure he made it.  It was nice having company too, but be plodded along at 10 minute pace for 1.3 miles back.  He about barely made it.  Later, he called me his 'running angel' and bought me a drink to say thanks.

Anyway, I doused myself again, drank another liter, and headed out.  I was able to make it 3 miles, but only barely.  I was really feeling the strain on my body at this point, and I had barely a half marathon under my belt!  The heat was a killer.

Another shower, another liter of water.  I figured I could get in the next 6 miles in sections of 2-2-2.  Then, on my way back from this loop, I just ran out of gas.  Legs were giving way, I was dehydrated, and hypoglycemic.  My vision was starting to go a little funny, so I decided to call it quits.  There was just no point in going on.

Good workout on the track today. Legs were a little more tired going into this.  I think it's because I rode my bike to work today.

I could definitely feel that this was hitting the anaerobic system well.  Pretty happy that I got to do something faster on the track.  Reminded me of my first AT run--how I was pretty tired on the first one that was short, but then as my aerobic threshold got better, I was running longer at an easier effort.  Same goes with today--I was feeling a little uncomfortable, but I know it's because I'm just starting to touch LT pace.

Downside to the workout was that my left arch was pretty sore afterward.  It warmed up just fine and felt ok during the workout, but ached on the c/d.  Iced at my house afterward.

First things first: ran in the A5s and had no arch pain.  I was super pumped about that.

Started out the run with the Mirages and tried to go without the inserts.  Only made it about a 1/3 of a mile, decided against it, and ran back to my house and slipped in the inserts.

What a difference that made.  Once I had the inserts in, the arch pain was relieved and I was able to get in the whole run with relatively no problem, and no significant arch pain following the run either.

Looks like I might have to be relying on the inserts for a bit until I get this foot stuff under control.  I'll keep up with the icing, eccentric strengthening, towel curls, and massaging.  Hopefully I can get back to normal soon and not have to rely on the insert."

Lots of stuff to do in the workout today and it took a while, but I got through it all.  Did everything except the 100s and 200s on the track in the Fastwitch.  Did the track stuff in the A5s.

Took 220mg of over the counter Naproxen sodium 4 hours before workout and I had a little bit of foot trouble, but not much.  The question I'm fighting with now: is this sustainable?  Should I take NSAIDs for a little while (~week) and see if that helps me? Or is it just numbing the pain and letting me push through while making the injury more severe?  Those answers still TBD.

As far as the workout is concerned, I started out feeling pretty sluggish (legs were tired even during my easy morning run).  Was able to hit the times on the track, but they didn't come that easy.  May have also been because I ran them in the A5s instead of spikes, like I have been for a while now.

Hill repeats went pretty well, but the legs felt heavy and slow.

Also, on the warmup, as I was running by Kroghetto, a bunch of high school hoodlums (likely from Hughes) thought it would be funny to throw a rock at me after I passed them.  It was a rock about the size of my fist and whizzed right past my head.  I abruptly stopped, turned around, and saw them pointing and laughing.  For whatever reason, I just snapped.  They probably thought a screw was loose.  I started screaming at them and running after them all.  The one who looked behind the most and trying to run away the fastest instantly became my target and I started chasing him down screaming, 'I'LL RUN YOU DOWN! YOU CAN RUN 10 MILES IF YOU WANT! I'LL RUN YOU DOWN 20 MILES!' His eyes were about the size of dinner plates when he realized I was legitimately pursuing him.  He ran down the steps to the parking lot of Kroghetto and stopped in the corner where he could hold some defense while I screamed, hairs on end, 'DON'T MESS WITH RUNNERS!'  I was furious.  He was stumbling over his words and mumbled out, 'It wasn't me man, it was that other kid...' to which I responded, still at the top of my lungs, 'WELL YOU TELL HIM NOT TO SCREW WITH ME, OR ANY OTHER RUNNERS! WE'LL FRICKIN' TAKE YOU OUT!'  Man, I was on like red alert.  I can't remember the last time I was that angry.  Anyway, that got my system pretty well jump started and then I trotted off to the track to start the workout.  My blood pressure was probably through the roof."

Easy run from the house.  Interesting progression of the foot pain today.  Started out feeling fine, then I started getting some pain, which increased up until mile 3, then leveled off for about 1/2 a mile, and then subsided until mile 5, where I had no pain through the end of the run.

So, the good news: I had no pain finishing my run and no pain afterwards walking around.  I think running in these inserts has helped stabilize extraneous movement in my foot that was causing excessive inflammation and has also helped me pinpoint the area of pain: the abductor hallucis.  But luckily, I think it's restricted to a muscular problem only there, which should hopefully heal quickly.

Also, split up the run with 6.6 and 1.8, with KMack in the middle since I was a lazy bum this morning and didn't do it then."

Decided to do my workout around the lake at Eden Park today and get in some soft surface action.  Was glad I did that, as it felt a lot better on my foot than the track likely would have.  Arch felt ok during the workout, but I was having a little pain in the cuneiform bones again, which is weird.  Did the workout in the Matumbos.

Felt more free on this workout than on the track, as there was no 200 mark to check splits, just ran on feel.  I measured the loop several times and found that my 400m mark was pretty accurate with the whole loop being ~520m.  Alternated directions every 5 reps.

Good effort during the workout today, but nothing that put me over the edge.  Was very pleased at the end of it."

Easy run up to the Armory to do some KMack and then return home.  Left foot started out feeling fine, but then by the end of the first mile, I was already having some pain in the retinaculum.

The pain gradually increased over the next mile until I was at the point that I thought, 'I'll just turn around and make it home.'  But then I decided against since I was so close to UC--I could at least get in my strength session.

When I got to UC, I decided to pop off the shoes (Kinvara) and run a lap on Sheakley barefoot to see how my foot responded to that.  To my surprise, my foot felt much better barefoot on the turf. I then went on to run a full mile with very little aggravation.

Went and got in my strength routine and then came back out to do another mile on Sheakley to see how the foot held up.  Again, another mile with little irritation to the foot.  Threw on the Kinvaras and ran home, focusing on proper pronation and coming off the big toe.  That seemed to really help and I got home without any additional pain.  My foot felt fragile on the way home, just no pain.

So, perhaps the issue is supination in the left foot due to the limited mobility I have in dorsiflexion of my big toe?  That was something that Nick Bobinger had suggested.  I'll ask Yost tomorrow."

Ran in a stiffer shoe this morning to try and simulate running barefoot on the turf.  That seemed to help and I got through the run without any particular local discomfort, but my foot still didn't feel 100%.  

Started with some discomfort in the retinaculum and then it seemed that the discomfort just radiated from there.  It's hard to pinpoint all the different locations, but I can say that I'm now icing my whole foot at work."

Gettler stadium was being used for a soccer match, so I had to do my workout on Nippert on the turf. Distances are pretty close, but I couldn't remember exactly the layout for the different distances.  I would say that I was within 10 meters.

Ran out of splits on my watch for the 200s, so I just looked at overall seconds, was happy to hit 32s.  

Foot felt good the whole workout--I was happy about that.  The whole workout was a big shock to the system though.  Legs were shocked right from the get go on the 300s.  Got through it all though and was happy with my effort at the end.  I finished feeling like I had just got beat up in a fight.  I was pretty sore.

As for my foot: I saw Dr. Yost before the run and he didn't find anything significant in the extensor hallucis, abductor hallucis, or the inferior retinaculum.  He guessed that there is probably just some friction going on between the tendons and perhaps a bit of adhesion, so he mobilized the area as much as possible.  He also found a trigger point at the insertion to the abductor hallucis, so he worked that out.

Per his suggestion, I'm going to take NSAIDs for the next 4-5 days and see how everything feels.  I took 220mg of naproxen prior to this workout.  Here's to hoping I'm healthy!"

Headed down to Nashville today, so wanted to get in this workout before I got down there.

Beautiful weather and the workout started well, but those sub 4:50 miles were not quite in my lactate threshold today. My calves were still rocked from earlier in the week, so those miles just didn't feel as comfortable as I would have liked. I had to push pretty hard on the last mile to hit goal time. I. In retrospect, it probably would have been better to back off a bit on the pace and go more off feel.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this workout.  It was tough, but much more under control than last Friday at Lunken.  I felt strong today.

It's started raining during the first mile, and the started pouring during the second mile.  The rain did help things though--cooled me off and all.  Only downside was my spikes got waterlogged and I was slipping around a bit in them."

Had a blast.  Just so much fun to get to race on the track again.  Felt really blessed just to be able to go out there and run a healthy race.

I was thinking that I was in about 14:15 shape, so it was nice to come through and have that happen.  Felt pretty strong, just not fast.  The pace was definitely beyond my LT as of now, since all my workouts have been geared around the half marathon.  Halfway through, the pace was getting to me, but then with a mile to go, I saw the finish line and got a second wind.

After finishing, I recovered rather quickly and then went out for a 5 mile AT run to try and get in some more quality volume, since tonight's race replaced 8x1 mile @ 4:45-4:50/1:30 rest.  Realizing that's a pretty key workout leading up to the half, I wanted to get some more work into the legs.

Did 5 miles in 27:30 (5:33, 5:36, 5:31, 5:31, 5:19) and then cooled down with another mile at 7:01.  Felt pretty strong during that, only had to push a little on the last mile to keep pace, and ended up being able to pick it up a little.

Good solo long run.  Slept in this morning after a night out with UC Track and Field athletes from the past 3 decades after Bill's retirement party.  It was a really good time.

Also did this after visiting my beloved Grandmother, Rose.  She's in the last day or two of her life and I said my final goodbye to her.  It was pretty tough seeing her like that, but I know that she is ready to rest.  She lived life to the absolute fullest and shared so much wisdom with me over the years.  I'm really going to miss those long conversations at the kitchen table at her house full of lively stories and endless laughter.

All of that made for somewhat of an emotional long run as I reflected upon her life and how much she meant to me.  It made the transience of life real, tangible.  Don't ever give up the chance for making memories, for love and laughter, for joy, and for happiness.  Each day is a gift, a beautiful gift to share our lives and love with each other.  I am probably the most guilty about forgetting this and today was a reminder of the wonderful and blessed life that I live.

I hate to call this a failed workout, but I guess it is what it is.  I just didn't have it today at the end to cut down.  The first two miles of the AT felt a little uncomfortable, but then I settled in a bit, never quite feeling in the groove.

When it came time to cut down, I just didn't have the juice to make it happen.  I tried my best, but the energy reserves just weren't there.  It was rather disappointing to not be able to hit this workout.  Going into it, I didn't even think it would be that difficult.

It's pretty disappointing to have another sub-par workout.  Back before my foot injury, I rarely had bad workouts.  I can't remember the last time I had two in a row.

McMillan says that you shouldn't be too disappointed when you have a bad workout because it cues a bigger training stimulus for the body, but that's hard to believe with two in a row now.  Is it all just mental hocus-pocus or is it really true?

Took an ice bath after the workout and am doing the little things to try and get my legs whipped back under me and absorbing the training again."

Easy easy morning run.  Trying to force my legs back to feeling better by going easy on them.  They still felt like junk.

Got in KMack and body was sore during that too.

I'm pretty sure I'm getting enough iron, but I guess it wouldn't hurt to get a supplement just in case."

Easy morning run.  Skipped KMack in favor of more sleep and more recovery, in light of how rubbish my legs have felt this week.

Felt a little better than yesterday morning, but still on the recovery trail.  Talked to Randy last night and we're going to push this afternoon's workout until tomorrow to give my legs a little more time to recover.  So up on deck is another easy run this afternoon and then the LT interval work tomorrow."

Was out in Starlight for the strawberry festival and did this workout with Lupp.  It was a huge mental and physical boost to have company and then have the workout actually go well. Felt like my legs finally got back under me and I felt much better than the last two workouts.  

First rep was net downhill, so I guess my legs were still trying to get warmed up since I missed my split.  Second rep was net uphill, so I was pretty happy with that split. Third rep had some undulating hills on the end, so I had to dig a bit to hit my splits, and then the fourth was all flat and I cruised to time.  

Very happy with this workout and just very happy to be feeling back to normal."

Good long run with Lupp.  He went 18 miles with me and I added on an extra two.  Just a simple out and back route and kept it relaxed the whole time.  Legs were feeling the workout after mile 14, but I stayed relaxed and road the train till I hit the station.

Beautiful weather along the country roads of farmland in Indiana.  Really peaceful long run."

05/28/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,12.00,miles,4800,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"UC Track - Campus Loop - 5:00pm

Workout on the track and campus loop.  Didn't feel as snappy in the legs as I had expected.  Miles 1 and 3 of the tempo were net downhill, with 2 and the end net uphill (ran clockwise around campus).

Had to push more than I thought I would have to on the 200s to try and hit times.  Combination of unsettled stomach and the heat that had my breathing off, so I just couldn't get in as much recovery between reps.

Still not feeling as strong as I should be in workouts and runs--I feel like I'm more tired than usual and legs are just lacking pep.  Weird, since I'm sleeping about an extra hour each night this week trying to get my body back on track.  Hopefully I'll get out of this rut soon."

Easy solo run.  Went faster than I had thought and had to slow down intentionally a few times, yet my legs still didn't feel all that great.  Still some residual soreness in there and feels like if I were to try and hit the gas, I'd run out of fuel pretty quick.

Got extra sleep last night too."

Legs felt ok this morning, but still not feeling as good and easy as they should be on these morning jaunts.  At least my easy effort this morning produced around 7 min pace, instead of 7:30 pace."
05/30/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,7.75,miles,2942,,,Fastwitch 6,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Riverside - 5:20pm

VE-AC for 6 miles (6:27, 6:24, 6:10, 6:14, 6:19, 6:05)
6x100 @ 3k-5k effort/100 jog (6 min/mile pace)
1 mile VE c/d (6:48)

Found it difficult to settle into a comfortable rhythm during the first 6 miles.  Each mile felt better, with the 6th being the best, but I just couldn't lock into the 6:20 zone I was looking to achieve.  Kept changing pace trying to get comfortable.

Legs still not feeling as peppy as I would like, which has me a bit concerned for the race on Saturday, but hopefully they'll come around just like they did last week for Saturday.

Onward and upward.....looking for that team training environment.  One day soon."

06/01/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Race,8.80,miles,3600,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"MCDC - 9:25pm

Pretty happy with the race tonight.  I was surprised to be back under 14 again--I didn't quite think I had that in my legs after the last two weeks of workouts.  Seems that the down week gave my body enough time to catch up and for the training stimulus to take hold.

Wasn't sure I'd be under 14 at 3k as I was feeling pretty beat, but was able to suck it up and take over at 4k and still finish strong.  Again, feeling stronger than I am fast still, which makes sense given my training being geared for the HM.  Looking forward to some more good workouts and the US Half Champs!

Easy run with Lupp and Dave Adams.  Well, for the most part it was easy.  Legs were a little sore after the race and getting up the big hills on the 11.2 loop took it out of me a little bit, but on the flats I felt decent.

Good week of training and time to get ready in the next few weeks for a big race!"

Ran this workout with TK.  Was really happy to have some company and he felt likewise--it worked out pretty well.

Legs weren't the snappiest today, but was able to hit the prescribed times without too much effort.  The 200s at the end felt like a breeze.

VE-AC morning run.  Got out and took a couple of miles to warm up, but was feeling pretty good.  Legs were a little sore, but the whole run felt pretty comfortable. Leg soreness was probably from doing the lunges and squats yesterday for the first time in a while.

Easy afternoon run after work. Started feeling unwell by the end of the day.  I think it's probably just the lack of sleep the past few nights.  Stuff keeps coming up and I haven't gotten the rest I need."

I slept in a bit to try and fight off the weird way I felt last night.  It's like my digestion system just wasn't firing on all cylinders and I wasn't absorbing all the nutrition I was shoving down my mouth.

Anyway, slow start to the day, but felt good and relaxed on the run."
06/07/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,12.00,miles,3970,,,A5,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Miami Whitewater - 5:53pm

2 mile w/u (6:32, 6:04)
4x100 stride/100 jog
8 mile tempo in 40:10 (5:01, 4:59, 4:58, 4:56, 5:06, 5:02, 5:09, 4:54)
1.5 mile c/d (10:19)

Goal pace for the tempo was 4:50-5:05, so I'll call the workout a pretty good success, especially since the last couple of longer tempos I've run haven't gone so well.

The 7th mile (5:09) was definitely the toughest, as it was a decent net uphill.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with how it went, especially since I ran it solo on a gradual rolling course with some decent wind at times.

As well as this went though, it was certainly tough and has me rethinking my goals for the HM in 2 weeks.  I think on a really good day I could hit my goal of sub-64, but it's looking like a tougher mark to hit after workouts like this.  If I had some more time on my hands to crank out a few more of these, I'd be sitting a little prettier heading into the race, but I think I'll still be able to have a very good race.  I'll know in 2 weeks!"

Good long run this morning. Legs were still a bit worn from the Friday tempo, and I came into this run a bit dehydrated, so I didn't feel quite as good as I would have liked. Hit up a few water fountains throughout the run though and kept plugging along.

4x15 sec striders starting at mile 14 to shake things up a bit."

Workout on App State track, which is at 3,333 feet. A billboard proudly displays the elevation.  I wonder if the track is at 3,333.33 feet.  

Anyway, it was a solo workout, but Cameron and Warrenburg were there, as Cam was doing his last hard steeple workout before USAs.  I was aiming for the high end of the specified times, as the mild altitude apparently makes each mile ~7-8 seconds slower.  Taking that into consideration, it was a pretty good workout,  Felt pretty good with the longer rest, but I could tell that my legs were just having a harder time recovering between reps.  Hard to pinpoint it solely on the altitude though, event though that's a nice excuse.  I'm also not used to doing workouts in the mornings, so that could have had an effect as well.

In either case, it was a good workout and I was happy to be able to get some faster stuff on the track without wearing myself out."

Slept in this morning and skipped my intentions to do KMack, as even with sleeping in, I didn't quite get 7 hours of sleep.  

Legs felt like junk.  Probably a combo of the workout yesterday, the long drive, and then shortage of sleep. Sort of just slogged along this morning."

VE-AC run out and back. Ran with the ol' Garmin so I knew when to turn around, but forced myself not to look at the splits (something I'm way too into the habit of doing) and just ran based upon a brisk easy feel.  

After the last two morning runs, I was pretty surprised that I ended up locking into 6:30 pace and felt so comfortable.  Good run and it cooled off here a little in Cincy after a heavy storm rolled through this morning.

I really ought to get into the better habit of using the Garmin as mere feedback--not as an input."

What should have been a moderately easy workout took more effort than I would have liked.  I mean, I basically did this same workout on 4/12, but the effort level wasn't any easier today.  Legs just felt burnt out. 

I didn't have to dig to hit any of the times, but I just didn't have any spring in my legs.  I know I'm fit, but I just need to get some proper rest to try and get the pop back into my system before next Saturday."

Slept in big time and got 10 hours of sleep.  Felt amazing to get so much sleep.  I'm hoping that will bring some life back to my legs.

Played some sand volleyball last night, and of course, with my luck, I dove for a ball going out of bounds and crashed into some cement stairs.  My knee and shin knocked the cement and it sounded like a cue ball dropped onto a tile floor.  Luckily, they're just pretty scraped it, but no real bruising.  I did jam my right toe though and it was swollen for the run today, but I got through the run just fine."

Easy solo 'long' run.  Last long run before the US Half.

I wish my legs would have felt better for this, but they simply did not, so most of the run hovered around 7 min pace without feeling that great.  

Again, not sure why I'm feeling so off, but I'm doing everything I can to try and get some spring back into my legs.  Going to take this week pretty easy and get extra rest to try and snap back.

Additionally though, this was a strange long run.  I found this 1.6 mile gravel path that ran along the Licking River that I had never seen or heard of before in my 6 years of living in Cincy.  It was actually a really nice path and I was super pumped to find some 'soft' surface close to downtown.

While on the path, I got solicited for some lovin' by a girl in this turquoise dress, and then about 4 minutes after that, I passed an East African wearing a full Nike kit (never have seen that before in Cincinnati).  I was so perplexed.  Felt like I was still dreaming.  Said hey to the African, but he just stared back at me bug eyed.

Then when I got back to the Cincy side of the river, my old high school rival (Logan Singleton from Goshen) passed me riding his road bike.  Haven't seen that guy since we ran against each other in high school.

Overall, just a very strange long run."

Early workout to try and get body ready for early effort on Saturday.  Woke up a bit earlier and got a honey stinger and some coffee in first.  

Easy warmup to track, then did 6x100 stride/100jog, then 2x100 (50 buildup, 50 fast)/300 jog before going into the workout.

Workout felt good, but again, just like on Friday, my legs just didn't have the bounce they should have.  And I could feel the lactate acid in my legs when I should be able to zip through a workout this short without any problems whatsoever.  

So....on the plate for the next few days is some EASY running to try and get plenty of oxygen to the legs and try to up the blood pH a bit.  I shouldn't feel so tired.

On an optimistic note though, this is how I felt before I ran 13:44 a couple of years ago, so hopefully my legs come around just like they did before."

06/22/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Race,17.60,miles,7200,,,A5,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"US Half Marathon Championships - Duluth, MN - 6:15am

Up and at 'em this morning with a wakeup time of 3:20am.  Got up and did the normal pre-race routine of a little something to eat and a cup o' joe.

The weather was perfect for a fast race--49� and a slight tailwind with overcast skies, and fog rolling off Lake Superior.  I got to the starting line a little late and as a result, ended up in about the 8th row.  When gun went off, people were pushing their way to get started and I crossed the start mat 2 seconds after the gun.  I then proceeded to pass 94 people in the first mile to move up and get in the second pack with Tim Ritchie.  I thought that would be a good place to be for the first part of the race.  Little did I know that Tim was gonna blaze a 62:28 after an opening mile of 4:33.  

When I saw that split, I eased up a bit and let that group go, and by mile 3, the sub-64 train rolled up on me.  I joined them and just rode the train for a while.  Some miles felt good, some miles felt hard.  Miles 4-7 clicked by pretty quickly and I was just focused on someone's jersey ahead of me, trying to stay relaxed.

Then at mile 8, I went to go take some water and as I tried to sip it down, I choked on it a bit--rookie mistake #2 for the day.  As I was trying to regain my breath, the sub-64 train left the station and I was still on the platform, struggling to hold on.  So I just tried to relax again hoping that I would be able to slowly reel them in again.  Unfortunately, that never really happened and they just kept slowly putting distance on me as I drifted away into no-man's land for the next 3 miles (which explains the 5:04, 5:07, 5:10).  

Once I hit 11.5, a couple of Hansons guys and Kevin Castille pulled up on me and that sparked my pace a bit (hence the 5:02).  But at that point, I just didn't have much gas left in the tank and they pulled away from me right before 12 miles.

The last mile was just wishful thinking of seeing the finish line and having it be over.  Another Hansons guy passed me at about 12.5 and I was pissed, but I just couldn't respond.  At least once I hit the final straight, I was able to kick a guy down.  

So overall, good and bad.  I was disappointed in 32nd place.  I was disappointed in not breaking 64 either.  But there is some good as well--I was able to get under 65 on my debut and the training for this HM has really gotten me into good aerobic shape.  Now I can just put some icing on top of this cake and really run some faster shorter stuff.  Can't wait to get back to that 5k!"

Easy slog on the lake trail with Lupp.  We ended up bumping into Ricky Flynn on the way back and ran with him for a bit.  Passed Meb and he was just chugging away and gave us a wave.  Flynn told us he had already been out there running for over an hour like that.  Jerk.  

Legs were pretty sore, and left calf was especially tight for the first few steps, but then it eased up and we plotted along."

Man, today was a for real Monday at work.  Just got slammed with stuff and paid the price for having taken Thursday/Friday off for the race.  Got started on the run a bit later.

Nice easy run--legs surprisingly felt decent.  Better than yesterday and not too bad. 

Only thing bothering me is my left calf, which bothered me all last week too. It might be slightly strained.  Two weeks ago I had a knot in the soleus, but didn't take proper action to get it worked out.  Now I may be paying a little bit of a price for that."

Just tight in the L soleus, hopefully nothing too serious.  He did a little ART on it and then told me to keep icing, I'll see him again on Friday.

Calf was tight for the first 2 miles, then loosened up and felt decent the rest of the run.  Took an ice bath following the run."

Morning thunderstorm run.  Rain wasn't coming down too hard.

Back to the standard morning run/strength routine. It has been a little while.  Nice getting in some good strength work.  I avoided two of the exercises which put extra strain on the calf muscles.

Ran into Book, GSands, and Hauser in the Armory doing their thing.  Good to see those fellas staying on top of strength stuff in the mornings."

Was going to run Mt. Storm, or something of the like, but then ran into Ali on the edge of campus and joined her for some Grandin action.  Slowed down a bit for my miles with her, but no biggie since this week is recovery anyway.  We hovered around 7:10-7:20.  She later admitted to me that she was doing a pseudo-tempo anyway, so it worked out for both of us.

Did miles 2 - 6.75 with her, then peeled off and ran home.

L soleus is feeling marginally better.  Still feeling it on the run, especially when I get started, but not as much.  Still need to keep watching that I don't go too hard on it.

Met with a big crew from Team USA Minn and we all started out together, but strung out after a few miles (mainly guy/girl separation).  Running around the lakes in MSP was just awesome--amazing trail system and nice beautiful (summer) weather.

Ended up doing most of the run with Antonio Vega and had a really good chat with him.  He gave great advice and perspective to post-collegiate running.  It's a shame the guy has been injured so much.

Calf started out sore, but then got better as the run went on.  Not sure if that's because I just got used to the strain, or if it was really feeling better.  Will find out tomorrow."

Was a little worried on the warmup, as L soleus was real tight getting started.  But then once I got finished with the warmup, it was feeling much better and loose.

Had a hard time going slower to hit 34s today--legs were feeling really good and fresh since I haven't done any anaerobic stuff in a week.  Plus the weather was real nice because a thunderstorm ended up rolling in a few hours later.

By the end of the workout, both calves felt just about the same.  

Dunked the L calf in a ice bath following the workout and rolling it out."

Met up with Moser and then we met up with a couple of other guys, including the Cincinnati Legend....John Sence.  It was actually the first time I ever met the guy.  Cool getting to chat with him for a bit.

Anyway, just an easy morning jaunt.  L soleus was pretty tight starting out, but then loosened up after a mile.

Saw Yost following the run and he says that it's just general tension in the calf, no one spot is too tight, so he's not too concerned about an injury.  After some ART, he had me do stem with contrast (6 min ice, 6 min heat)."

Wasn't too worried about that, as I figured that would happen with the prize incentive. Saw Andrew Poore while warming up and talked to him on the line and thought he was supposed to be on the European Circuit--and he was--he left 2 days later for a steeple in Budapest.

Anyway, I was still feeling good about the race, but then after a mile in, I thought a couple more of the Kenyans would be falling off, but instead it was me falling off at 1.5.  I'm just in Half Marathon shape right now, not 5k shape.  Just not sharp enough for the body to handle that kind of lactate shock right now.

Anyway, once I fell off and was out of the money, I sort of just cruised it in.  I kept pushing, but just not like I would if I would have been fighting for 3 grand up front.

Longer cooldown and got a chance to chat with Poore and his friend Sarah who runs for Rogue Elite down in Austin.

Found out after the race from a friend that the guy who got second has tested positive twice.  So on the day celebrating America, not only did I get beat by Kenyans, but by an Ethiopian who has cheated [EDIT: Thanks for the correction BoyFromIten]. Happy 4th.

Debated on whether I should have ran today or not, as the superior part of my L gastroc (behind the knee, just inferior to the distal hamstring) was pretty tender.  Also feeling a little tender in the superior part of the L achilles.

Was glad that I did run, as it gave me some feedback on my L calf.  After about 1.5, the achilles loosened up and was feeling good.  The gastroc also felt better as the run progressed, but still felt tender the whole time.

The good news: no more achilles or superior gastroc pain.  

The bad news: still having some acute pain in the lateral part of the L soleus.  Started off fine, but then slightly and gradually increased throughout the duration of the run.  Most troublesome when hopping up to a curb or springing up a hill.

What gives? You would think 3 weeks off would take care of any small soft tissue damage.  

Did my normal PT stuff following the run followed by an extended self massage on the trigger point ball.

Made the run a little shorter today to lessen the load on the L calf.  Seemed to do pretty well, didn't really degrade over yesterday.  Felt a little more of the achilles at times, which is why I cut out coming back up Main Street.

Going to keep up with the PT stuff and perhaps just go run 3 miles on the turf the next few days to see how everything keeps responding.  

Gotta get healthy!!! Man, as soon as I'm in monster aerobic shape after the half marathon, BAM.  Didn't get a chance to top it off and zip off a quick 5k.  Pretty bummed, but it'll happen eventually.  Going to be a 3 year gap between 5k PRs now.  But I believe it's going to happen."

Easy run after work.  Legs were feeling good and my calf felt great!  Only thing I'm having now is some tenderness in the soleus following runs.  Just going to keep up with the PT stuff and keep massaging that sucker out.  Eventually it'll get back to normal.

Followed up the run with some steep hill springing to work on eccentric strengthening of the calf muscles and achilles.  No pain doing that either, so I'm getting out of the water here."

Ran up to Burnet Woods because I knew the fellas were doing some hill repeats there.  When I got there, they were still doing them, so I jumped in on the last 4.  4x60s @ about 10K effort with an easy jog back down recovery. 

Felt good to do something that was mildly harder and calf held up pretty well to it.  Great to have a little company from the old teammates on the run too.

Finished with 3 reps of uphill springing on Decker Alley next to my apartment."

Tough getting started this morning...definitely need to be getting more sleep.  Was up last night nailing down all the hostels for my upcoming trip to Italy and Zurich (along with legendary Lupprxc and the not-so-fit Collmar).

Anyway, quick turnaround between runs and calf was mildly tender during the run, but overall felt pretty good.  Followed up with my PT routine after the run and spent a little more time rolling it out on the TP ball and decided it was worth going into work late for that.

Also a beautiful and crisp 55� for the run.  Ran shirtless and received a few comments about it being cold, but my favorite was, 'OH NO.......OH HELL NO.......YOU BETTA PUT ON SUM CLOATHES BOYYY BEFUR IT START SNOWING!'"

Met up with TK at Eden Park and then went for an easy jaunt through Cliftonia.  Nice going for a bit of a longer run and having some company.  We mainly discussed the WC action that had been going down. 

Saw a bunch of people that I knew on the run.  That's always a lot of fun.

While we were stretching following the run, these two ladies came back to the parking lot, only for one to discover that her car had been straight up stolen.  She asked if we had seen anything, and then called the police.  Rough day."

Easy morning jaunt.  L calf was a little sore during the run and I'm guessing it was from a quick turnaround between runs.

I might go for a bike ride tomorrow to keep from over stimulating all the muscles in the calf.  Not sure--I'll go by feel and see how things are holding up tomorrow."
08/17/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,6.10,miles,2564,,,Cortana 3,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"IFP - Elm - 10:00am

Slept in and took my time to get moving this morning.  Wasn't sure if I was going to run or bike, but the calf ended up feeling pretty good when I woke up and going for a run was definitely the right choice. Achilles and calf felt great during the run.

What didn't feel all that great was after about 4 miles, when I bonked on a short easy run.  I had one of my veneers redone yesterday, so I got all novacained up, which messed with my appetite.  So today, I was just low on fuel and felt it pretty fast."
08/18/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.00,miles,4344,,,Cortana 3,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Cincinnati Nature Center - 12:10pm

Went out to discover some new trails for a run after church and I'm so glad that I did.  I cannot believe that I hadn't run here before with all the years I've been living and training in Cincinnati.  Of course I would finally check out these trails and find out they're pretty darn nice one month before I leave Cincinnati.  Only downside to the trails was the $8 admission, but you can get a $20 annual pass.

Wasn't sure if I was going to do 8 or 10 going into this--just wanted to play it by ear and see how the L calf/achilles felt while running.  Soreness jumped around a little bit during the run in the area, but no pain, and it didn't increase throughout the duration of the run, so overall, quite a successful 'long run'!  I was pretty pumped to be able to get in such a session on soft surface and feel so good.

Again, trails were great.  Some hilly parts, so not the best for a long run that has any faster portions incorporated into it, but it makes for a great strength building session."

Didn't eat enough for dinner last night, so was running a little low on fuel this morning, but other than that, a good morning jaunt.

Got home from work and calf was feeling good, so I decided to give it the double test today and see how it held up.

Thankfully it felt awesome--no problems whatsoever.  I started out easy, then picked it up a bit with a 6 flat third mile.  Was doing a stress test, of sorts.  Passed with flying colors.  Watch out Nick Ross--I'm coming for you.

Finished up the run with 6 reps of hill springing up Decker Alley.

Finally got in a run with the Saucony Virratas, courtesy of Luppfontaine.  They felt great.  I could really notice the zero-drop difference, but it felt good.  I'd like to run more easy stuff in these (morning runs and such) once I'm back to 100%."

Same course as yesterday afternoon.  Again, calf was feeling really good.  A little bit stiff starting out, but eased up and felt fine by the end.

Finished up with 6 reps of hill springing up Decker Alley.  L Calf felt a little weak doing that this morning--I may be overdoing it a bit on this stuff trying to stimulate the calf back to normal. 

Overall pretty pumped to be getting back to health.

Ran from the Bed and Breakfast up along the river to the Olympic Stadium.  Tried to get inside, but it was to no avail.  Went to the practice track right next door, which was the coolest track I've ever seen.  Just so inspiring.  I wish I had my camera to take a picture myself, but this <a href='http://www.5cense.com/12/running/olympic_stadium_rome.jpg'><b>pic from online</b></a> will have to do to show how amazing it was.

Met an Italian 400m runner named Yaco Bocco (sp?) with a PR of 46.9.  We chatted for a bit at the track and it was really neat hearing him tell me about the Olympic Village and all.

First workout with Team USA Minnesota. Ended up doing the workout with just Jon and Matt Grey as Carlson and Peterson were on the track doing a tune up for a 10k this weekend.

Dennis originally had me scheduled to do 4 and told me beforehand that everyone always runs the first workout too hard, so I put it in my mind to try and run a little more conservatively, especially since this would be my first harder workout since before the US Half in June.

The workout ended up going extremely well--it wasn't like fireworks were going off or anything--but it worked out very well to run with the Grey's and stay on pace with them.  Since I felt pretty good through 3, Dennis had me tack on two more, which I was pretty pumped about.

Solid first workout and many more to come!"

1.3 mile c/d (6:44, 6:41)

Ran with Jon Grey and he is absolutely more fit than me.  I was sucking some wind by the end, but it's just because this first sub LT run was back to back days with my first LT interval day.  It's about time that I get back into shape.

I'm being very careful this week about recovery since the intensity of my runs is taking a bit of a spike.  Dennis only wants me to single this week and keep the volume the same, so my body should be able to handle the increase in intensity without breaking down.  

It is enormously helpful for recovery that I don't have to get up at 5am.  Also not having to work 8-9 hours in the office is a huge plus.

He did more of them (24) and he did them faster.  He was looking real fit.  It was good to do hills with a guy who has wheels like that though.

The hills weren't especially overall tiring, but each one got me breathing pretty hard.  Dennis wanted each one at a pretty hard effort, but they weren't long enough to totally zap you.

Another great workout in the books and I can already feel that my fitness is going to be coming along very quickly."

Long run with the Grey's this morning.  Man are those guys fit, and man am I getting my butt whipped into shape.

First half of the run was around 6:15 pace, then the second half we picked it up to around 5:40s.  I was feeling pretty good in the 5:40 range, more comfortable than I did on Tuesday, but then at mile 14 when they dropped down to 5:27, I threw in the towel and let them go as I was quickly approaching threshold, with the intention of the run being at sub threshold.

After the Grey's took off, I added on a few more miles in the high 5:40s and then cruised it in.  Good run and getting fit....just need to keep the body in check.  Left hammy a little touchy after the run, but I have all day and tomorrow to give it a good rest and stretch before things turn up again."

Easy out and back on a trail Collmar had tipped me off about and it was sweet.  Just a single track trail, but it made for some really nice running on soft surface.  A decent number of turns--just enough to engage different muscle groups and keep it from getting monotonous. 

Garmin flittered around a bit with the tree coverage, so pace may be a little off, but I just tried to keep it a nice easy recovery day.  Left hammy felt fine today.  Left calf/foot a little sore towards the end, just need to keep up with my stretching and I'll be fine.

We started out faster than last week and my legs definitely felt it.  No progression for me this week, I just tried to hang steady throughout the workout.  

5 was a little quick and I crossed my threshold, so I backed it off a bit to keep the effort in the right zone.  Jon pulled away from me on each one, but that's fine for now--I'll be right there with him soon.

Great workout and we had an extended cooldown because Dani just loves to run forever.  Note to self: don't do cooldowns with Dani."

Out and back with Travis Burkstrand on River Road from his place.  Felt much better than last week on this sub threshold. Not only did I feel more comfortable, but I did 2 more miles at sub-LT and finished feeling pretty good.  Pretty happy that the body is catching up and absorbing this training load so well.

Went through 8 miles with Travis and then he peeled off, so I added on the last 4 solo.  Great run and when I finished up, Travis had made breakfast! Gotta start running with this guy more if he's gonna feed me post-run!

Easy morning run with Dani on the trails around the park. Pace is all over due to tree coverage/trails, but it was a nice relaxed recovery run.  Good company and good conversation.  All the soft surface was perfect for recovery after the past two days.

Saw Travis our PT afterward and he was incredible.  He had me do three squats and then checked me out for a couple of minutes laying down and was able to identify and accurately predict where I have typical soreness and explained the root cause of each one.  I was really impressed.  He worked on me for a while and took it easy since it was my first week.  Looking forward to more tuneups with him."

Faster session on a gravel path on the island with Travis, AC, and Dani.  Meghan warmed up with us as well.

The path was slightly uphill on the odd repeats,  Felt pretty good thru the first 10, then the last 6 was a little bit of strain, but did my best to stay relaxed.  Also on the last 6, for the first time in my life, a marathoner out-sped me.  Carlson claimed that he 'finally warmed up' and put a dusting on me.  First for everything on this team.

Took the cooldown pretty easy.  We ran by some organization on campus giving out free donuts, but they only had one left by the time we got there, so we split it four ways.  Good thing we did, because it was a powdered donut, which is the absolute worst kind of donut you want to eat when your mouth is already parched dry.  It was so hard to chew and swallow while running.  Made for a rather comical last mile to the cooldown though.

Easy solo run on some trails.  This place was absolutely gorgeous and the trails were fantastic.  Made for an excellent run and good recovery.  I will definitely be going back out to this park again soon."

Ran with Jon Grey on a similar route to last week except we went around the lakes and on the greenway in the opposite direction.

Jon didn't drop the hammer on me this week, so I felt much better this time around than last.  Good long run and just getting in lots of quality miles.

Went to Roy Griak after to watch the races and it was a pretty good time.  Some high quality racing.  Then the storms rolled in and it cooled off, so I took off before the women's D1 race since I was so cold."
09/29/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.00,miles,4133,,,Virrata,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Pike Island - 7:45am

Easy solo run with two laps around Pike Island.  Wanted to make sure that I could get onto some soft surface today for some easy recovery.  Felt much better towards the end of the run than when I started, so getting in a nice restorative run certainly fulfilled its purpose.

Beautiful fall morning and really enjoyed the solemnity of the island."
09/30/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,13.30,miles,5120,,,Kinvara 3,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Riverside Park - 8:32am

Threshold intervals down at the park with Jon and Dani.  Jon wasn't feeling so good again today, so he went 6.  I was feeling pretty good through about 5 and then just did my best to maintain.  Pretty good workout, just another day of fitness building in the books.

Legs seems to be absorbing the workload pretty well simply because I'm sleeping and resting more.  Hopefully this keeps up and I stay injury free for some fast racing!"
10/01/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Medium,14.00,miles,4907,,,Fastwitch 6,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"River Road - 8:30am

2 mile w/u with 12 @ sub-LT

Started from Burkstrand's house and went out to river road, same as last week.  He was thinking about going 8 for his sub-LT, but then wasn't feeling too hot so he ended up going 6 @ sub-LT.  I ran 4 of that with him and then doubled back on river road to get in my extra 6.  

Was feeling pretty good through 6, then probably pushed a bit too much on 6-9, and then paid for it during 10-12.  Last three miles were decently tough and I was doing my best to stay relaxed, but was sucking some wind.  

Forgot my garmin, so I felt pretty naked out there.  I do have some splits though from the mile markers that Travis has mapped out:

2 mile w/u in 13:01
4 mile segment in 23:14 (5:49/mi)
2 mile segment in 11:10 (5:35/mi)
2 mile segment in 11:33 (5:46/mi)

Easy run with Ben and Dani.  It was good to get in some easy recovery on soft surface out here.  Beautiful trail running and good company.  Had some great conversation about Team USA MN.  

Ben threw me a pair of Adidas Tempos to try on for the run, so I gave them a go.  A little stiff for trails for my liking, but a decent shoe.  It would probably go over better on a harder surface moving at a faster clip."

24x100m uphill, jog back down recovery (26:59 total)
4.1 mile c/d in 26:37 (6:31/mi)

Warmed up with Travis and Dani, then did this workout alone, as they did 200s on the less steep hill in preparation for their races this weekend.

Legs felt like junk warming up from the accumulation of the past few weeks.  Once I got going in the workout though, I was feeling pretty good.  I felt like I was going hard on each one, but I wasn't chasing Travis this week, so they were likely a little slower.  Between that and a bit of increase in fitness, this workout went much more smoothly than 2 weeks ago.

Was feeling good on the cooldown, so I just rolled with it.

10/04/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.10,miles,4399,,,Kinvara 3,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Theodore Wirth Park - Kenworth Trail - 8:20am

Went exploring for a bit in Theodore Wirth and just simply couldn't find a good groove in there.  The soft surface stuff was constantly up, down, left, right and I couldn't get into a groove and the paved surfaces were so-so.  Maybe it was just the part of the park I was in, but after 5 miles I just got fed up of it and finished up my run on the Kenworth Commuter Trail.

Pace was all over the first 5, then I settled into 6:40s or so once I hit the commuter trial.  Legs were feeling pretty good today.

Things are getting exciting with the Twin Cities Marathon this weekend!  Should be really fun to be part of all the events and get to watch some good races."
10/05/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,18.00,miles,6413,,,Cortana 3,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Calhoun - Harriet - Minehaha Pkwy - 6:05am

Early morning long run before heading over to the Twin Cities Marathon mile/half-mile/kid's fun run events.

Was a bit tired getting started, but then hit a groove by mile 4.  Things were clicking along pretty well until about mile 15, then I had to give a little extra to maintain pace.  Could be because this was my first solo long sub-LT.

10/06/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,9.70,miles,4079,,,Kinvara 3,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Pike Island - 1:45pm

Easy run with Becki and Peterson.  And boy did it need to be easy.  Becki and I biked about 40 miles this morning cheering people during the TC Marathon.  It was a blast, but it wiped us out.  We did a terrible job of eating and hydrating too, so it definitely showed on this run.

Just kept it nice and easy, but was happy to finish this run."

Thought I was going to have to do this workout solo today, but Ben Sathre has been coming back from his knee injury and joined me for the first four, which was really great to have company.

Was pretty tired from the weekend and didn't have high expectations for the workout, but it ended up going much better than I had anticipated.  Didn't mean to go so fast on the last one, it just sort of happened.  Very pleased with how my body is handling the workload here.

Another workout in the books!"

Last 13.1 in 73:56....not that it really matters.

Beautiful morning for a run and did this one solo since the others were doing 1200s today at the park.  This week I held back a little bit 6-9 since it was that section that did me in last week.  Overall, this run went much better and I finished feeling way smoother than last week.  Great run! I love running in Minneapolis."

Bigger crew today and did the hills with Peterson and Travis.  Peterson had an 'aha' moment and came up with a name for the three of us who are trying to break 4 this winter: the JET Crew...(John, Eric, Travis....pretty clever eh?).  

Anywho, a great workout and I'm getting better at handling the hills.  Legs are definitely getting stronger and it's well complemented by an increasing aerobic capacity from the sub-LT runs.

Followed up the run with one set of isometrics, and then did one set of plyos with Dani and Travis.  Tough, but it was good getting into those.  Looking forward to doing more."

Early morning run that started out with a bunch of people and parsed down to me, Peterson, and Ben Kampf. 

Legs were unbelievably sore from the plyos yesterday.  I felt like I had been hit by a train.  I can't believe just a few of those plyos could make me so sore.  I about joined the 9 min pace group today.

Right hammy was a bit touchy for the first few miles, but everything felt normal by the end, minus all the soreness.

Even my back is sore...how did that happen!?"
10/12/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,19.50,miles,7050,,,Cortana 3,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Lakefront Trail - Chicago - 5:45am

Early start on the day since I was meeting Lupp and he needed to run before working the marathon expo. Ran 3 miles to meet him, then ran his first two miles, then took off on my sub-LT. Was hitting around 5:50s and aerobically I was doing fine, but my legs were still shot from the plyos on Thursday.

Turned around and then hooked back up with Lupp when he started his 5 mile tempo and we hit 5:30, 5:33, 5:31, 5:28, 5:29. Backed it off to 6:10ish after that and cruised back to his hotel, dropped him off, then picked it back up to 5:40s the rest of the way back.

Longer than I had planned and more pace changes than anticipated, but a good run and it was awesome to run with Lupp again. That guy is getting fit! He looked like he was jogging at 5:30 pace.

Now it's time for a nap."
10/13/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.00,miles,4150,,,Cortana 3,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Chicago - 7:00am

Ran around Chicago with a big group of guys cheering for Craig. Had a great time, despite the serious lack of sleep. Every year I come here to watch I stay out way later than I should the night before the race and every year the morning of the race I regret it. Oh well, young and restless.

Got in about 4 broken up miles during the race, then got in a steady 6 following. Awesome to see Craig run 2:13:53 for 13th place.

Chi-Town....always a good time!"
10/14/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,13.30,miles,5100,,,Fastwitch,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Riverside Park - 8:35am

Bigger workout crew today (Jon Grey, Jon Peterson, Ben Sathre, Dani Stack) and the weather was perfect.  Feeling like true fall here in Minnesota.  

Surprised myself a bit today given the lack of sleep the last couple of days and less than ideal recovery from workouts.  Was still able to keep it below threshold and felt good the whole time."
10/14/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,7.10,miles,2940,,,Kinvara 4,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Lake Harriet - 6:30pm

Easy solo jaunt and was a bit tired, but overall feeling good.  Man it's getting dark quick.

Took a nap this afternoon to try and catch up from the weekend and I think that helped a bit with my energy levels.  Hopefully this sub-LT goes off tomorrow without a hitch."
10/15/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Medium,15.00,miles,5162,,,Fastwitch,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Augsburg - River Road - 8:35am

Met up with Jon Peterson and Ben Sathre for the sub-LT today.  When we got going, Peterson took off a bit and me and Sathre ended up going together the whole way.  Sathre dropped off at 10 and I kept going for 12.  Was a little more aggressive on the sub-LT today, but I think it happened just because Peterson was out in front.  Felt good and relaxed through 10, and then running the last two solo was a little more of a push, but still under control.

Overall a good run.  Followed up with holds and plyos.

Splits: 5:32, 5:31, 5:30, 5:31, 5:26, 5:29, 5:30, 5:31, 5:28, 5:31, 5:24, 5:29 (average = 5:29/mi)"

Easy run with Heather, JPete, and Lance.  Kept it a little slower today and I wasn't complaining.  I definitely needed an easier day after the last 4 or 5.  

Good morning for a run and Pike Island was pretty nice, as always.  Dennis mentioned about doing a sub-LT on the island yesterday, so we might try that next week and see how things go."

Had a good crew of Burkstrand, Peterson, and Grey today.  I think all of us were running with some heavy legs, but the workout went pretty well.  As Dennis said today after the workout, 3-4 weeks of this you start to feel pretty tired, but if you can string together 8-12 weeks of this and come out on top, a lot of really good things can happen.  On week number 5!

Easy solo trot around the lake.  Legs were toast.  Slowed it down and just tried to stay relaxed and get the miles in.  But boy are my legs tired.  Combination of mileage and not getting enough sleep the last two days that's probably wearing on me a bit.

Went to do plyos after the run, did the lunges, and then called it quits.  Legs were just too sore."
10/18/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,11.10,miles,4824,,,Kinvara 4,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Lebanon Hills Park - 8:30am

Easy solo run through the park.  It was drop dead gorgeous out there today with the leaves turning color and the crisp air of the fall morning.

Legs started out a little heavy, but felt better as the run went on.  Ended feeling really good and a bit restored from the workouts this week.

Supposed to have snow here tomorrow in Minneapolis.  I guess that's true Minnesota fall."
10/19/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,20.00,miles,7046,,,Cortana 3,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Minnetonka Regional Trail - 8:45am

Solo long run out on the regional trail, which was nice crushed gravel the whole way.  Very similar to the Tow Path in Akron/Canton.

4 mile w/u
14 miles @ sub-LT (average 5:38/mi)
2 mile c/d

Felt pretty good through 10 miles on the sub-LT portion, but the last few miles was a little tougher than I would have liked, so I backed it off a bit to try and keep the effort in the right zone.  Right hammy also got a little finicky by the end, which I think is the result of my right hip giving way a bit on these longer harder efforts.  I've been having Travis pay attention to that on my weekly tuneups with him at PT.

Glad to have the rest of the day to rest and recover.  Going to give my right hammy some special attention with that foam roller."
10/20/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,10.70,miles,4837,,,Kinvara 4,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Lebanon Hills Park - 8:30am

Good crew this morning with Heather, Ben, Lance, JPete, and Meghan.

Took it a little easier and my legs definitely needed it after yesterday.  Hamstring felt fine, but my right hip is still sore.  Need to be doing more clams to strengthen it up to stay healthy with this training.

Another week in the books.  Going to focus more on recovery this next week and probably back off the sub-LT a bit to make sure I'm not edging too close to the line."
10/21/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,13.30,miles,5133,,,A5,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Riverside Park - 8:40am

Big crew this morning since the girls are back, so we had Peterson, Grey, Sathre, Meghan, Heather, Ben, and Lance.

Cold start to the day and we had our first snow during the workout.  I guess 'real' Minnesota fall is here.  Times were a little slower today and I think that was a combination of the course being a little slick and the accumulation of fatigue in my legs.  Still ran a decent effort and just have my head down in training. Stay healthy and consistent through these next 8 weeks and some exciting stuff will happen."
10/21/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,7.00,miles,2845,,,Virrata,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Harriet - Bird Sanctuary - 5:00pm

Easy afternoon run with Grey and Peterson.  Warmed up a bit this afternoon and was able to rock the shorts, but still had to wear a jacket.

Legs are feeling much better and recovered over last week already.  Still will probably back off a bit on the sub-LT tomorrow depending on how I feel to keep from overdoing it."
10/22/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Medium,15.00,miles,5208,,,Fastwitch,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Minnetonka Regional Trail - 8:15am

Met up with Peterson and Sathre for the sub-LT. Went a little quicker than I wanted to through 6-8, and then backed it off a bit just so I was in the right zone.  With the gravel surface, our feet were slipping a little bit, so the effort was a little more for the given pace.

In any case, a good run.  Perhaps still a bit too quick given the circumstances, but hopefully the body is able to handle the training stress better this week.

No problem with hip or hammy today, so feeling good about that.  Followed run with holds and plyos.

Splits: 5:33, 5:39, 5:34, 5:39, 5:33, 5:27, 5:32, 5:31, 5:35, 5:37, 5:36, 5:30 (average = 5:33.8/mi)"

10/24/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,10.60,miles,4333,,,Fastwitch,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Nicolett Island - 8:40am

Good crew of Peterson, Grey, Burkstrand, and Peyton.

Legs didn't feel so hot on the warmup and the first few, but then after about 4, they came around and I started feeling better.  The odd reps were slightly uphill and the even reps slightly downhill.  It's all on loose gravel too, so our feet were giving way slightly on each one.  It'll be interesting to see what kind of times this translates into once we hit the track.

Felt pretty good throughout the whole workout and better than I did a few weeks ago when we only did 16.  

Followed up the run with holds and plyos.  Will do another easy trot later this afternoon."

Met up with Dominic Smith for an easy trot.  Who would have ever thought there would be two runners from New Richmond, OH living in Minneapolis?? Crazy small world. 

Dominic is up here getting his PhD in economics at UM and I randomly ran into him at Afro deli last week, so we got together for a run.  Was great catching up with him.  I think this was our first time actually ever running together.

Good recovery run.  Right hammy was a bit touchy at times, but feeling good overall.  Will have to keep an eye on that, especially with the long run tomorrow."

What a disaster of a run.  I can't remember the last time I had to stop and walk because I felt so bad.  This was even worse than Jan 13, 2013 with Lupp.  And that was the worst long run I had in a while.

Started to get sick yesterday after my morning run and progressively just got worse throughout the day.  Woke up this morning with a sore throat and energy levels just low.  I had slept in another two hours to try and fight off the sickness, but that just made me lethargic when I got going.

Decided I was just going to accept whatever pace my sub-LT was and still try to get in the 14 at pace with 20 total.  What ended up happening was 10.5 @ 5:53ish pace and then I had to literally sit down and try to focus my vision.  I had been running the slight uphill along riverside drive for about 6 miles at that point and there were 15-20mph wind gusts in my face pretty often.  It was demoralizing.  It felt way too hard to just get under 6 min pace.  So finally on one particular degrading uphill, I just pulled the cord and decided it just wasn't worth it.

Took a quick squat and regained my composure, and then started the lengthy slog back to my house to finish out the run. At mile 16 my vision was going blurry again and so I walked for a few minutes.  Then I sucked it back up once I got my head back on my shoulders and finished the run.

Spent the rest of the day on the couch eating soup, taking vitamin C, and resting.  

I really don't want to do that again."

Easy morning solo run.  Was feeling much better than yesterday when I woke up.  Sore throat is gone and I just had some nasal congestion going on.  Seems like my recuperation technique of 'be lazy in front of the TV on the couch for 12 hours' worked like a charm.

Started off easy with Sathre and the Jons, then did the sub-LT with Sathre since Grey and Peterson are racing this weekend in The Pitts.

Was feeling pretty good through 6, started to run out of energy by mile 9, last two miles I was doing my best to just focus and maintain.  The cold weather was making my face go numb and my vision get blurry.

Right hammy twinged a bit at mile 4, then felt good, then I felt a bit uncoordinated with the right leg for the last 1.5 or so.  Going to have Travis give it a good rub down tomorrow."

Solo trail run this morning.  Ran the section of the park across the highway that I had never run before at the end and that made for a pretty hilly last 3 miles.  Other than that, it was as good as ever.  Running at this park on recovery days is a gem.  

Just ran by easy feel today and didn't look at my watch once.  

Had Randy Cox, my former post-collegiate coach, email me yesterday and he commented that my training is pretty 'dense' right now.  I liked that word to describe what I'm doing right now.  Take a snapshot of any particular few days and it's nothing to brag about, but string it all together and it's some dense training.  Just hoping that I can absorb it all and come out the other end on top.  

The trials of miles!"

Good workout today with Grey, Burkstrand, Sathre, and Peyton.  Legs are pretty tired from accumulation and I took it a little easier just to make sure I didn't overwork the hamstring since it's been a bit touchy lately.

Workout went off without a hitch and didn't have any issues with the hammy.  Was pretty pumped about that.  Not quite as fast as last week, but I'm just worn down a bit from all the mileage.  I seem to still be recovering quite well though from everything and am making sure my easy runs are easy (see: yesterday's pace).

Man, if Burkstrand doesn't completely blow through the 4 minute mile here in a couple months, I will be shocked.  That guy is fit.

Followed up with holds once I got home.  Will hit the plyos after the double this afternoon."

Easy run with Nick Ross the Boss.  He refused to let me do my routine 7, so off we went somewhere else.  I'm a man of routine, what can I say?

This run came shortly after a late lunch, so I was a bit full while running, but it still went well.  Finished up the run with 2 sets of plyos.  First time I've gone through the whole routine twice.  Some soreness is in the forecast for the near future.

Anyway, this brings to a close the month of October.  Some quick stats:

1. 3rd highest mileage month ever
2. Highest mileage month since September of 2011
3. Last time I held this kind of mileage (2011), I had a breakout year of 13:44 (5k) and 29:54 XC 10k

Things are looking good!  Dennis even told me today at practice that he was excited about my track season.  When he said it, he smiled and kinda bounced on his feet.  I'm told for him to show excitement that it means quite a bit."

Easy run with Dominic.  Legs were a little beat up from 2 sets of plyos last night and right hammy was a bit sore.  I think from a combo of the plyos and then I was pretty aggressively treating it with the trigger point ball last night, so it's likely sore from that.  No pain though, so I'm feeling good about that.

We talked about the two times that we raced (once in HS and once in college) and how Dominic totally smoked me both times.  Not even a competition."

Met up with Nick Ross this morning for an early long run before headed to the MN HS State XC meet, and then the MIAC meet.  Wanted to get it out of the way so I didn't have it hanging over my head for the rest of the day.

Gotta admit, I was a bit less confident going into this since I blew up so badly last Saturday and my hamstring has been a little questionable.  What actually ended up happening was the best long sub-LT I've had since I've come here, so that was a nice surprise.

Ross stayed with me for most of it, peeled off at 10 for a quick bathroom break, then joined me for the last 2 after the turnaround.  

Great run and finished feeling strong! Huge thanks to Ross for the early morning company.

Sub-LT splits: 5:46, 5:43, 5:41, 5:40, 5:43, 5:42, 5:42, 5:42, 5:45, 5:40, 5:24, 5:41, 5:33, 5:31"

Easy solo run in the afternoon.  Was up to watch the NYC Marathon first, went to church, and then went to get this in.  

It was one of those beautiful fall afternoons where I just glided along the trails and it felt effortless.  Just amazing.

Lots of people out on the trails this afternoon with how nice out it was. 

Legs are feeling good and ready for this next week of training! Got a different schedule lined up for this week...and maybe a race! Stay tuned!"
11/04/2013,12:00 PM,Run,Medium,15.10,miles,5294,,,Fastwitch,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Midtown Greenway - Cedar Lake - Kenilworth - 8:20am

Got to take my first crack at the 15-10-10-5 workout today.  The legend of this workout spreads far and wide.....well, not really, just Jon Grey was talking it up big time a few weeks ago.  Anyway, everyone tries to run 5 min pace and go 3-2-2-1.  It's supposed to all be at threshold with 2 min rest between work bouts.

Ran this workout solo and for my first crack at it, I would say that it went very well.  Especially considering that I haven't done anything longer than 1200m at threshold pace before this.

3 mile w/u in 19:40 (6:33/mi)

15 minutes - 3.0 miles (5:00/mi)
2 min jog (7:13/mi pace)
10 minutes - 1.98 miles (5:03/mi)
2 min jog (7:12/mi pace)
10 minutes - 1.95 miles (5:08/mi)
2 min jog (7:06/mi pace)
5 min - 1.0 mile (4:59)

3.4 miles c/d in 22:32 (6:38/mi)

Overall I'm pretty happy with how this went.  I was recovering pretty quickly between work bouts and felt strong on the cooldown.  I just couldn't really go any comfortably faster on the intervals.  Feeling strong, but just not fast.  So pretty much exactly where I should be at this point.  And to be able to do this after 108 miles last week gives it another good perspective.

Followed up run with holds.  Will do plyos and try out the weight routine tomorrow.

Easy solo run from Augsburg.  Busted out the tights today for the first time this season, but I think I was a little early, as I was pretty warm on the run.

Just ran out northwest from Augsburg and then crossed each bridge coming back starting at the far end of boom island.

Felt pretty good.  Followed up the run with learning the weight lifting routine.  First time I have ever done squats and cleans with a bar.  Needless to say, I looked like a total n00b.  

After weights I ran through the plyo routine out on the turf."

Easy solo run.  Trails were pretty nice minus about a 1/2 mile stretch that was really slick mud that caked about 2lbs of mud onto each shoe.

Left achilles was a bit sore getting started and then warmed up.  Was sore afterward and it feels like a bit of tenosynovitis.  Popped an NSAID, hit the ice, and will probably skip on the evening double today just to be safe."

When I got into practice today and told Dennis about my achilles, he pulled the reigns a bit and just told me to go easy today instead of doing the planned hill workout.  Also just going to take the next few days easy and well until the achilles clears up.

This is what I get for being a bit greedy! I'm not too concerned about it and think it will clear up pretty soon. Hoping to be back on the horse by Monday.  Unfortunately, no Sunday 6k XC race for me now, but it's in my best interest to take a few easier days.

Taking a few easy days after so many weeks of intense training will be good too because it will allow my body to absorb the training stimulus and catch up.  I just don't like being forced to do it and would have rather made the decision voluntarily.  Either way, head is up and I should be good to go soon."

Starting to get a little chilly here in MSP (23� this morning), but not too bad.  

Headed to see Travis this afternoon for treatment and hopefully he can get the achilles feeling even closer to normal.  I think I'll be back by Monday!"

Easy solo run through the trails.  Beautiful afternoon for a run.  No problem with achilles at all until about 5 miles.  Then it started to get a bit sore.  Could also have been that good through 5 though since I popped some Naproxen this morning and it was doing its thing, whereas yesterday morning I had no Naproxen before the run.

Again, wanted to go further and legs felt so fresh and so clean, but need to pump the brakes a bit to nurse this achilles back to health."

Was hoping to be back on the horse again today, but achilles is still being a little wuss, so I'm still keeping everything in the cage.  Dennis pulled me back to just 5 easy today and tomorrow and we'll see how the achilles responds.  Will be icing all day and speaking words of encouragement to my tendon.  

In other news, it got cold in Minnesota.  It was 22�, but wind chill knocked it down to 11� and I couldn't feel my face for the first two miles as I ran into the unhampered wind along Lake of the Isles. That was pretty great."

Easy solo run.  Achilles was feeling better today, and on some flat sections it wasn't sore at all, but I'm still struggling a bit with uphills.

With that in mind, I just need to bite the bullet for being greedy and take some time off.  I don't want to keep pushing through this thing and struggling with it.  

So.....off to bike depression (hell, actually) for the rest of the week and hopefully I can re-emerge as a runner once again come Monday."

Morning solo session on the spin bike for 1:40.  When I walked into the spin bike studio, the lights were off and there was one other dude in there who was surprised to see me.  About 10 mins in, an instructor comes in and sets up some stuff on the bike in front.

Over the next 20 minutes, some people filter in slowly, and next thing I know, at 6am, with the lights still off, this spinning class starts bumping some music and this petite instructor is barking instructions at everyone in the class. They're all up, down, up, down, in and out of the saddle and I'm just sitting in the middle of this chaos.  

Not only am I in the middle of the class, but I'm literally in the middle of the room too.  Surrounded by people in this spinning class.  I'm sopping sweat everywhere over the bike and all over the floor while it seems like everyone else is barely getting moist.  Needless to say, I'm feeling a little out of place, but I just keep jamming to my own tune.

The class ends after an hour and I'm just about to start my cool down when people start leaving the studio and eventually all that's left are me and the instructor.  She packs up her stuff, walks by me with a very puzzled face, staring deeply into my sweat-drenched shirt and the salty lake that has formed underneath my bike.  She quirps out a quick, 'Thanks?' to which I respond in an also puzzled voice, not sure how to respond, with 'thank you?'

Drove out to Madison to watch the Great Lakes Regional XC race and crashed in Hauser's room.  Got up in the morning and found an elliptical in the hotel that I could commit suicide on and racked it out for an hour.

On the plus side of things, it was awesome to see the team race again and it was an absolutely gorgeous day for racing in Madison.  Being there as a spectator made me want to race cross country so bad.  I don't know if I have ever missed racing on grass so much as watching that race."

Morning butt-kicking session brought to you by Lifetime Fitness and Dani Stack.  She had a 2 hour fartlek session all worked out that looked like the following: 5min w/u, 5x1 (1 min rest), 3x2 (1 min rest), 3x3 (1 min rest), 3x4 (1 min rest), 2x5 (1 min rest), 3x4 (1 min rest), 3x3 (1 min rest), 3x2 (1 min rest), 5x1 (1 min rest), 12 min cooldown.  

Good session and got the heart rate up pretty high.  We were doing our best to simulate a typical good long run Saturday.  Nice to have company for a longer session, even though we both had our ears plugged up with tunes for almost the whole session.

On a positive note, the achilles is feeling pretty good when I've been doing my eccentrics and I'm feeling optimistic about some healthy running come Monday.

First indoor track workout since Feb of 2011! Was pretty pumped to go fast indoors.  It was exciting.  

Easy jog over to the fieldhouse, then finished my warmup inside. Dennis wanted me at Vo2Max pace, which I figured to maybe be 65s at this point, but I hit 64s pretty comfortably and was recovering pretty well between the reps. 

As expected, achilles felt 100% during the workout and all systems are go.  Time to start turning on some speed and get ready for US Indoor!

EDIT: after doing some digging through my log, when I ran my 5k PR in 2011, three weeks out I did 12x400 with 100m jog, 2:00 rest every 4 quarters and averaged a slower pace.  So, based off that, I'd say that I'm in at least equivalent shape, but I'm feeling pretty confident about being even more fit than that."

Easy run with Nick Ross in a windchill of -17�.  Man, that was a winter wakeup call.  Coldest temperature I've ever run in to date and it's forecasted to be colder tomorrow (-10� without windchill).  

Running over all the snow kinda sucked, but most of the sidewalks were bearable.  The worst was coming back West into the wind for a couple miles.  Couldn't feel my face for a while and it became difficult to enunciate words with my lips totally numb.

Out of frustration for the terrible footing on the footbridge and the relentless wind, I ended up mooning all of the cars stuck in traffic on I-35.  Just a display of how I felt about the unbelievably cold weather."

Solo run in the fresh -26� wind chilled air.  Today marks the first time in my life I've ever had icicles hanging off my eyelashes. I mean, you get to running for 12 or so years and you think you've just about experienced it all, and then something like this slaps you in the face.

Dressed better than I did yesterday, so I was actually quite comfortable, except the balaclava I was wearing kept icing over and restricting my breathing.  So I went back and forth with either a frozen chunk of material on my face, or exposing my skin to siberia.  I went more with the latter hoping that maybe I'll finally be able to grow a real beard as a result.

Anyway, besides the weather report, legs felt pretty good and just moved along well.  Finished up the run with 6x100 hard/walk back recovery in the bubble at Augsburg.  

It certainly feels good to be in shape.  Even with taking those two weeks off for my achilles, I'm still more fit than I've ever been in my life.  Indoor season is starting to look like it's going to be a lot of fun!!"

-10� (-26� with windchill)....made for a cold morning.  I was sort of dreading this run when I first got up, but I finally got out the door and it really wasn't that bad since the sun was out.

Just an easy long run (!!!), Dennis must be getting soft or something.  Legs felt pretty good.

Just terrible, awful, frustratingly bad traction.  We got a dusting overnight and there was just enough snow on top of all of the packed snow (aka: ice) that I was just sliding all over the place.  

My legs were a little sore and slow from yesterday, but slipping on every single step just exacerbated the problem.  On an upside, everything still feels relatively healthy despite the proclivity to get hurt in conditions like this.

Warmed up with the Kampfs, Dani, and Burkstrand in the bubble then did the workout solo since Burkstrand is still coming back from some shin issues.

The whole workout felt like I was just running through mud even though I was spiked up.  The turf was really soft and the air inside the bubble not so fresh.  Dennis also mentioned that the laps might be a little bigger and I may have been running a little further than a mile.  He said the year that Vega and Smyth went 1-2 in the US Half Championships that they were running mile repeats in 4:58 in the bubble and getting mad cause it was so slow.

In either case, the goal was to be around Vo2Max on the miles and I feel that I hit that pretty well, regardless of the times.  Finished up with some quick 200s and almost got mowed down by Heather on those.  That would have been just a bit embarrassing."

Easy solo run through winter wonderland.  I'm just asking to be blind with the sun reflecting off the snow so much.

Legs are feeling pretty good after yesterday's workout.  Hammies were a touch finicky, but I think that had a lot more to do with sliding on the snow more so than the workload yesterday.

Saw another bundled up runner around Calhoun also rocking the Cortanas, so when I passed I gave him a shout out, but he was too bewildered by another runner passing by to say anything other than a mumbled surprise."

When I arrived at Augsburg, I asked Dennis what my scheduled rest was and he said, 'Well, I was thinking if you could just go ahead and do them with no rest, then we could knock this sub-4 mile thing out of the way.'  It'll come soon enough...

Good workout.  Haven't done a sub-60 quarter in a long time, but felt pretty good doing it.  Only started to feel the pace and tie up a bit on the last quarter.  Good neural stimulation and I think there's a lot more in that range of speed that I have yet to develop.

Cooled down with a big crew, mostly some TCTC/Run 'n Fun guys who were warming up for their own workout.  Nice chatting with those guys and having company.  Travis joined us for a bit as well and he's on the comeback trail! Hopefully soon we'll be doing workouts together again."

2 mi w/u, 10 miles in 58:20 (5:50/mi), 3 mi c/d

This was my first ever workout on a treadmill.  And for good reason.  It sucked.  I was supposed to go 13 miles at pace, but after 10 I felt terrible and just couldn't breath.  The air was still and humid and my throat starting closing up.  It honestly feels like I have exercise induced asthma.  Even on the cooldown and once I stopped I was having trouble breathing and wheezing when trying to inhale.

Going to talk to our team docs and see if I can get a prescription for albuterol.  

Followed up the run hitting up the diner with the Kampfs and Peyton, which was pretty nice. Good to have their company an advice on a range of topics."

Thought I was going to have some company on this workout today, but Jon Grey needed another rest day, so I ended up doing another workout solo.  Not a big deal though as the Kampfs, Meghan, and Katie McGregor were doing 800s as well, so at least there were other people on the track.

Wasn't sure how I would feel going into this workout having not done this type of workout in a while, but it ended up going really quite well.  I felt pretty comfortable the whole time.  It was actually easier than the fast 400s I did last Wednesday.  It was still Vo2Max pace type work, but I felt really good at that pace.

What a beautiful warm morning....or so I thought when I first saw the forecast.  Trouble is with this temperature that the snow everywhere gets real soft and sloppy, so I was sliding on each step.

Wow.  I did not have the speed I thought.  I thought I'd be able to run a 53 today for the quarter.  Unfortunately I just flailed my way to tie my PR of 54.3.  

And this 800 style workout was a lot harder than I thought it would be.  I thought, 'Oh, 1100 meters, nbd.'  But I seriously can't remember the last time I actually tried to run all out.  It was much more difficult than I thought and I was pretty tired.

Ran this workout with Heather Kampf and I would let her start a second or so ahead of me and I would chase her down during the interval.  That was good for motivation."

Easy run with the Kampfs, Dani, Ross, and Dominic.  Snow was just killing our groove today so the pace certainly didn't reflect effort.  Plus the wind was just whipping pretty well out there today.  Face got numb pretty quickly and I wasn't so great at enunciation.  That caused me to not talk as much, which I'm sure others were happy about, but when I did, I'm sure it was a big ol' blubberfest."

Easy run with bossman Nick Ross.  Well, supposedly easy.  At one point we were literally running through 10' of snow uphill at the park.  I may have been hitting 10 min/mile, optimistically, at that point.

Nick Ross kept blowing it off like it was no big deal and he's tough as nails when it comes to winter running, but I know deep down inside that he's just a big sissy.

Long sub-LT today on the tow path....where it was 55�.  Christmas miracle.  I felt like a whole new man not freezing my nuts off each run.  I even ran shirtless to make the best of the weather.

The path is mainly crushed limestone and it was pretty soft due to all the melted snow and rain, but overall it was pretty good running surface.  Felt really good today, so tacked on another mile at pace to make it 14 @ sub-LT.  The best long run I've had in 7 weeks (11/2/2013).

Anywho, pretty good temps for the workout (33�), but a little windy on the homestretch.  Legs were also a little more sore than I had anticipated from the long run on Saturday, so I went into this with more fatigue in my legs than I thought I would.  Didn't really feel that great the entire workout, was tired from the first rep.

On the upside though is that if I can run this workout while tired, then I'd say my fitness is pretty good.  I was hoping to be able to hit all 62s today, so I think on a day where I was a little more fresh that could happen."

Then went to the exercise machine floor and decided to try an elliptical I've never used before. It was called the Octane Fitness Pro 4700. It even sounds cool, doesn't it? Well, I hop on this thing and I'm all jazzed about the fact that you can actually change the stride length. Simply amazing. I'm getting all pumped about finding an elliptical that's actually somewhat closer to what it feels like to run.

Well, about 5 minutes in, this thing just starts going haywire. I have it set at level 5 resistance on manual mode, but then it starts cycling on its own from about resistance 1 to 20 every 3-5 seconds. So one moment I'm spinning out of control at a stride rate of 200, then the next I'm almost throwing myself off the machine because the resistance skyrockets up such that it feels like I'm running through molasses. This madness continues for about 20 minutes while I wait for another 'normal' elliptical to open up (I was there during post-work rush hour). The whole time I'm frantically pushing all the buttons on the fancy touch screen trying to figure out why this machine is malfunctioning.

Finally a normal elliptical opens up and I've never been so happy in my entire life to jump on an elliptical. Get me away from that Octane torture fest. Cranked 60 minutes on that puppy and decided there wasn't enough soul left in me to keep going."

Thankful to OSR for having an Alter-G we can use. It was good to run again. Achilles had some mild discomfort that was inconsistent and neither improved nor worsened throughout the duration of the run.

Cancelled my flights to Indiana and Albuquerque this afternoon. Indoor season is looking to be meager, at best. Maybe I'll get to run a mile and see if I can match my high school PR. Pathetic.

How many more times will I miss races due to injury before I just give up? If I don't race indoors this year, it'll become a 4 year drought."

Brought a pair of shorts that wouldn't fall off today, therefore, I could return back to my 'normal' routine. Did only 5 sets because I'm hitting up the alter-g again this afternoon and then hopefully going out for a little xc ski action later with my roommate if he manages to be able to show me the ropes.

Was questioned by another guy after I finished if I was a professional swimmer because he's seen me in there everyday. I mean, maybe my workouts are a little longer than the average person, but I sure as heck don't look good doing it in the pool. I appreciated the compliment though.

Finally, for those who have been reading my log the past few days and thought to themselves, 'man, this guy might off himself,' I apologize. Just a hard pill to swallow planning to run US Indoors after joining a professional team and then having my body disallow me. It's frustrating as all get out, but that can be the nature of this business. I saw a doctor last night to prescribe a stronger anti-inflammatory (prednisone) and hopefully that will kick this tenosynovitis thing out of the way and I'll be back to regular running in the next week.

There was another girl in the pool this morning getting in at the same time as me. She's wearing a sport bra, compression shorts, and a pair of Nike frees (yes, in the pool). Safe to assume she's a runner and going to aqua jog recovering from an injury? I think so.

30 hard minutes on the spin bike. I didn't bring my swimming gear, so I just hopped on the bike instead. Perhaps not the best idea in retrospect because my achilles felt a little more sore after biking, which is why I stopped at 30 minutes instead of going longer.

I'm still confused why simply spinning makes my achilles more sore than even the 15 minutes on the treadmill."

Decided that biking to Lifetime every morning might be slowing my achilles recovery, so I drove to the St. Louis Lifetime since they have free parking. 

Mistake. Their pool was terrible. It was really warm and I think purified with one of those new age salt cleansers instead of good ol' chlorine. So the whole time I felt like I was swimming in a hot sea and it just wasn't pleasant. Then the sides of the pool just weren't at a good height for me to hold onto during my kicking routine, so it just was no bueno. Only put up with an hour of it and then called it quits.

Lots to say today:

1. Got acupuncture last night. That was....different. I really can't vouch for the efficacy after a single treatment, especially when combined with the next few items.

2. Went and saw Travis for some more manual manipulation before the run. While there, a trade show was going on at the school, so there was a guy demonstrating a super expensive shockwave treatment device, which is supposedly very good for treating tendinopathy, so:

3. I got treated with the shockwave therapy device right there in the hallway in front of a bunch of people who were listening to this salesman talk about the device. It was pretty interesting and it actually pinpointed an area of pain in the achilles, which I was surprised by. And then I don't know if it was the device or the way I was precariously standing while he was trying to demo it, but I started to get light headed and nauseous, so he had to stop the treatment about halfway through (he wanted to do 1000 'clicks' but had to stop around 600) so that I didn't throw up. 

4. Upon arriving to Augsburg, Dennis had me do 2 sets of some weighted calf raises, hamstring curls, and squats. So then finally that led to:

5. Got to do a mile of walk/jog in the bubble. There was no discomfort initially, but by the end it was a little sore.

So that brings me to the following conclusion: I have absolutely no idea what helped or hurt it out of all of those new stimuli. Dennis wants me to do the strengthening stuff tomorrow and try to run for 5 minutes on, 1 minute off. We'll see how that goes. And then Travis is bringing me back in on Saturday for another round of the nauseating shockwave therapy device and give that a go.

Frustrating to say the least. One of the next phases in treatment is using GTN fpatches, so I was able to get a prescription for those and will hopefully have them in soon to give them a go.

He suggested if I wanted to get more aggressive that I could get an MRI to see if there was any issues 'just to be sure' and then consider PRP.

Boy do I hate swimming. I think I just dislike it so much because it's always associated with injury for me.  It's never voluntary.  Anyway, same routine.

Saw a M.A.T. specialist last night in Encinitas and here's the report:

Didn't find any weakness or instability in legs, feet, or hips. She said that I am unstable in my left cervical in rotation and right thoracic in rotation. She was surprised not to find any instability in my hips. It appeared to me that there wasn't anything she could do to help my achilles in the short run, but by working on my neck/back, provide a more stable foundation for the future to lessen the likelihood of re-injury in the future.

I'm heading back in a week to see her again for a little experiment where she's going to test the strength of certain muscles, then I'll head out for a 10 minute jog, and then she's going to retest to see if there's a difference and try to determine if there's a specific weakness somewhere."

Got in my 5 x (500 swim, aqua jog) for my workout.  The aqua jog sessions are getting a little longer now, closer to 6 minutes since my swim is getting faster.

Also had a guy who swam in college some tips and pointers today on my form, which was good.  But really it was just the basics: longer stroke, head up.  Both of which I suck at.  Good to get that feedback.

Achilles hasn't bothered me the past few days and I'm itching to try running again, but I'm going to hold off until my M.A.T. appointment tomorrow for a short jog to see how things go."
02/26/2014,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,3.00,miles,1440,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Didn't swim this morning because a friend from Cincy came into town (Laura Eaton) and since I had an afternoon M.A.T. appointment, we got an earlier start on the day with seeing the sights in San Diego.

BUT, way more important is what happened later in the day:

Went and saw Debi Huber for a second M.A.T. appointment.  I was a little hesitant going in and seeing her again, but she said she wanted to do some strength tests, have me run lightly, and then retest me to see if she could find any specific weaknesses.  If she couldn't find anything, she wouldn't charge me for the visit.  So I agreed to her little experiment.

Got there, she tested some stuff, and then I went out and ran for 6 minutes, fully expecting my achilles to be sore by the end of it, even though it's been feeling so good lately. Well...I finished 6 minutes pain free!  She then ran some strength tests on me and just kept working high up in my back and neck.  And then she told me to go 'play' again for 8 minutes.  

I again left the office with exuberantly at the opportunity to run.  About 80% of me was thrilled with 20% of me haunted with the thought of feeling pain on any one of my next steps. Eight minutes passed, I returned to her office, still without pain.  I couldn't believe it.  I specifically asked her, 'What kind of magic spell did you cast on me? Whatever this anti-pain spell is, I like it.'  She was likewise happy and then spent about 20 minutes further working on my back and upper neck.

And here comes the kicker: she told me to go play for another 10 minutes.  I was a little worried for my first day back, but she just wanted to make sure she wasn't missing anything and if my achilles started to hurt, she thought she mind find something else. Went for 10 minutes and returned pain free yet again!  I literally could not have been more excited.  I was grunting with joy (yes, grunting).  The cars driving by probably thought I was a mad man, and they would have been right.

I returned to Debi's office and she worked on me one more time and then told me to take it easy the next week and let her know how I feel.  She may or may not have me in one more time before I head back to MSP, depending on how I feel the next few days.

So here's my take on my return to health:
1. Rest. I have been resting more than ever in San Diego.  I'm not even walking around much here.  I even cut out Alfredson's eccentric heel drop routine because I wasn't responding favorably to that for the first few weeks.

2. The GTN patches.  Yeah, the studies show significant improvement after 12 weeks of use in a double blind study, but doesn't mean that there weren't improvements after only 2 weeks.  It just means they weren't statistically significant enough to report.

3. M.A.T. Specialist.  I was disappointed after my first visit with Debi, as it honestly didn't really feel like she was doing much.  And even with my appointment yesterday it didn't feel like she was doing much, but I guess that's because I'm so used to the A.R.T. 'no pain no gain' style of treatment.  But I think what she was doing with my back certainly can help moving forward in preventing the likelihood of re-injury in the future.  Big thanks and shout out to Brad Gloyeske for recommending M.A.T. and helping me find Debi for treatment."

I really did not want to swim now that I had tasted the sweet nectar of freedom.  So I didn't.  I went to the gym and then did 4 sets of 5 minute jog, 2 minute walk.  Totally pain and tenderness free.  Was pumped again.

Then did isometrics and ab work in the gym before heading back home.

Holy smokes it feels good to run."

Did 2 sets of 10 minute jog, 2 minute walk today.  And the thrilling part, again, is that I have no pain, discomfort, or tenderness.  I feel like I'm finally out of the woods with this thing.  Pretty darn pumped about that.

Took two months to get back to health, but I'm simply happy just to be running again.  Now just need to keep the reigns on things and focus on the process.

March 1st. 60�. Shirtless, sunny. 

Along the ocean front as the waves crashed ashore in Carlsbad. Fresh ocean breeze and other runners out and about.  

I felt renewed.  What a beautiful run.

Went 15 minutes, walked 2, then 15 minutes back home.  No problems at all with the achilles.  I feel like a new man!  So thankful."

Easy out 15 minutes, 2 minute walk, returned home.  Achilles is feeling good!

It rained a bit during my run and when I was finishing up, the neighbors were walking out and called me 'brave' for running in the rain. Response was easy, 'I'm visiting from Minnesota.'"

Resurrected the battery dead Garmin and beeped it back to life as I took off for a no-walk test jaunt.  I would say that it was rather successful and that the past few days I was running about the same pace, but just called it slow based on time.

Very excited that I was able to go this far without any breaks and have the achilles feel solid the whole time!"

My last full day in here in California.  It's been a successful visit:

1. Warm weather
2. Renewed spirit
3. Return to running

I told myself if I was running by the time I returned to Minneapolis, then it would be a successful trip.  I can't be happier just to be running again.  I'll pull a section from <a href='http://ericfinanruns.blogspot.com/2014/03/sunny-socal-winter-update.html'><u>my latest blog post</u></a> that describes my run this morning:

I ran along the beach boulevard with the sun warming my skin, a fresh breeze at my back, and the sound of the ocean waves crashing ashore. I navigated to an abandoned road near the beach, closed my eyes, took a deep breath of the salty air, and ran in pure bliss. The rhythmic beating of my feet on the ground was matched by that of my heart. Cloud nine. I arrived.

Last run in Carlsbad before heading back to the tundra.  Got up early so I could get it in before catching the early train to the airport.

Just amazing running along the boulevard before the sun came up and hear nothing but the sound of my feet hitting the pavement and the waves crashing ashore.  The moonlight was just enough to see the outline of the waves as the arched and then crashed into the sand.  Bliss."

Met Jon Peterson for an easy run.  Turned out to be not so bad out.  20� and the sun was shining.  Weird to run on snowpack again though.  For the most part the footing was fine since it had been compacted pretty flat.  Also was a decent test for the loading capability of the achilles and I came out of the run unscathed.  Feeling pretty good about my progress so far, just need to keep it in check.

Also excited to join the Saucony Hurricane team! It's been a little while in the making, but it's a good first step into the sponsorship world.  Hopefully it'll be a nice springboard to greater heights."

Met Ben Kampf and then we picked up Reneau and Erin (a guy who just moved here from Wisco...didn't know last name). 

This morning was a mistake.  I told Ben a maximum of 8 miles...but then when we got to Nokomis to take the shorter way home, the path was under about 18' of snow, so we had to turn around and go the long way back home.  I wasn't too thrilled about that, but I guess the good news is that my achilles felt fine the whole time.

Right hip and foot a little sore, likely from having to stabilize on all the slick surfaces we hit.  Black ice of death just about everywhere because yesterday was warm and then it all froze overnight. 

Will go shorter tomorrow and maybe on the treadmill just to keep things under control."

Easy run with Jordan Zwick around the lakes.  It was straight balmy out at 38�.  And since it got up into the 50s yesterday afternoon, the paths weren't nearly the slushfest they were on Sunday.  

Good easy jaunt on mostly solid ground.  Happy to report that right hip and foot felt fine today.  Was a little worried after the accidental longer run yesterday, but I felt in the clear today."

Decided against hitting the lakes again since the temp dropped pretty low overnight and everything was going to be frozen black ice of death.  It was boring doing an out and back on the greenway, but it was mostly clear with only a few icy patches.  

Good easy morning run before heading down to Savannah for a bit.  Original plan was to do Gate River 15k....but at this point I can run 9.3 miles in about 60 minutes, so that doesn't really do anybody any good.  Heading down and gonna hang out with Collmar for a week.  Maybe I can encourage him to run more.

Slow to get going this morning and my body hates me for yesterday.  Had to finish up a work project before I zipped out the door, which allowed a little more time for rehydration.

First workout back in a long time.  Felt great to go fast again!!!

Did this workout with Heather Kampf and she was right there stride for stride.  I know it's my first workout back and wasn't that fast, but it's still impressive to have her right there pushing the pace a bit.

Legs didn't really tire during the workout, but felt like it was my lungs holding me back a bit on the third rep.  Felt like asthma with how I was constricted.  I'm guessing it's just because it was a little cooler out and I haven't induced that kind of airflow in a while.

Still planning on an outdoor track season and confirmed by Dennis that we're still shooting for US Outdoors.  It's gonna be a squeeze to try and run 13:32 before then.

A stiff slap back to reality with a DBark Standard Long Run....AKA 'I don't believe in easy long runs.'  Didn't help that it was 9�, felt like 0�.  

Took the first two miles to warm up and then picked it up for the next 9 miles. Laid off the last mile as a cool down of sorts, but by then I was pretty tired.

Welcome to spring in Minnesota where the snow is coming down and the winds blow heavily in 9� weather.  It's quite wonderful.  More college kids ought to take their spring breaks here and lay out by the beach.

Oh, except for the black ice which lurks underneath a fresh layer of snow.  That devilish frozen treat surprised me on a turn by Harriet and I took the hardest winter spill of my life, tore through my favorite pair of tights, and had a healthy flow of blood down my leg.

Shook it off like a champ, mostly because I looked like a freshman falling down while waving to another runner as I made my turn, and finished out the run feeling fine.  Got back home and realized it took quite a bit of skin off, as I must've fallen on a rough patch of ice for it to shred my tights around my knee.

Took the rest of the day to get the bleeding to stop.  Could have been worse."

First VO2max workout back.  Ran it with Travis.  And by ran with, I mean got smoked by.  That guy is in really really good shape.  Still a shock to the ol' ego to have an 800m specialist straight up outwork me in a distance oriented workout.

We were going to hit the track, but Minnesota spring got in our way, so we ended up doing it on the River Road path.  It was pretty windy, so all of the odd intervals were into the wind.  Number 7 was especially difficult because a huge gust blew real hard for the last 150m or so and really slowed us both down.

I would say a pretty good first VO2max workout back.  Dennis seemed to be happy with it and said I was ahead of where he thought I might be fitness wise.  That was encouraging feedback.  I floated the idea of Peyton Jordan and he seemed to be halfway on board.  Depending on how workouts go the next two weeks, I might get the chance to race out there.  Hopefully be at least sub-14 in 5 weeks.  We'll see."

Solo workout.  Met up with DBark at Augsburg and then got going on this thing.  

I'm not quite sure what to say.  We had originally planned to do mile repeats, but then he modified them to Ks because he wanted me to be able to run closer to current race pace.  

That being said, that means that my current 5k shape is 14:22ish if this workout holds true.  Of course it was on a sandy path with the wind blowing a  bit on the odd intervals, but I guess it's still a reality check.  14:22 is decent....but I'm just hungry for more.  I realize I've only been doing workouts for a week now, but with Peyton Jordan as a possibility, I don't want to get out there and embarrass myself.

Standard sub-LT long run with a bit of threshold on the end.  Had a little too much in the stomach going into this one, so my breaths were shallower than normal and I had to fight the urge to vomit a few times.  I also ran into a 10-20mph headwind for the first 6 miles, so that slowed things up a bit and I just focused on effort.

I would say that overall a solid workout, but not the best.  Had I not been fighting the stomach issues, I think the sub-LT miles would have felt more comfortable and the threshold miles at the end could have been a little closer to 5:0X.

Originally planned on doing this workout tomorrow, but with a forecast of 6-14' of snow, Dennis decided to push it early by a day so we could hit the outdoor track, as he didn't want to do it indoors.  Weather was pretty crappy at 33� with light rain and a stiff wind on the backstretch.

Sort of an average workout I guess.  Or maybe that's just my interpretation because my legs felt like jelly after the 3rd rep.  I entered oxygen debt immediately and just didn't have any power or spring to my step.  I felt like I could accelerate at the start of each interval enough just to get going, but then it took all I had just to maintain.  

I mentioned it to Dennis afterward and he said it was expected with my long effort on Tuesday and that I shouldn't expect to have any sort of spring in my step until we taper a bit for a race.  I guess that means he's going to just keep piling on the effort and hopefully my body can keep up this time.  

Just a very different training system than college.  Got to believe in it and know that eventually it will pay off.  I warmed up and cooled down with Meghan and we talked about her first year under Dennis and how even though she PRd in the 5k, she was just toast at the end of the season.  But then the next year she found her rhythm and really took off.  I feel similarly about my first year under Dennis so far and just need to trust the process.

Perspective on the workout, perhaps it is better than I originally thought:

Easy afternoon jaunt.  The snowstorm melted by the afternoon and the path was clear, which made for a nice run.

I got the first stoplight down the street and a man smoking (and wearing a Steelers jersey) asks me, 'Why do you run!? Is it so you can breathe??'

'Just because you're breathing doesn't mean you're living.'  Conveniently the light changed and I could take off before he could respond."

Easy group run from Jamie's house since she came back in for the weekend.  It was so nice running with a big group and getting to chat with everyone.  Made me miss running with the fellas in college.  Definitely miss that camaraderie.  

Followed up with a nice brunch hosted by the Cheever's and good conversation on the sport as a whole, Team USA MN matters, and just life in general."

Solo workout on a rolling road course next to DBark's house in St. Paul.  It was an absolutely gorgeous day and my first shirtless workout of the year....at least in Minnesota.

I feel that it was a pretty solid workout, but I just wish my legs felt better.  I felt pretty comfortable on the first rep and thought it would be maintainable, but clearly it wasn't.  On the second one my legs just turned to jello again, just like the repeat 400s last week.  The accumulative fatigue in my legs is probably more than it has ever been and I just feel like I have no ability to push on the accelerator at all--I can only maintain.

Dennis reaffirmed that it was a good workout and that he expects me to feel flat from all the work we're putting in right now.  On the other hand, he did, for the first time, tell me to back it off a little on my easy runs to make sure I'm recovering better now that my workouts are getting longer.

If I can just hang in there through this accumulation period without digging a hole, I think I can come out on top and have some great races.   I just need to make sure I'm not digging down too far."

Easy morning trot.  Per DBark's instructions, I consciously kept it slower today and just relaxed on the run.  Very enjoyable morning run in the mid-40s.  Minneapolis is thawing out, so I got to run most of it on the dirt track next to the paths.  The soft surface was smoooooth like buttah."

Went for an easy solo trot and ran into Jamie Cheever, her boyfriend Michael, and Meghan Peyton at Harriet, so I joined them for the rest of my run.  Really nice to have some company and chat with them a little.  Also helped to keep the pace slower to make sure I didn't dig myself down any more.  Finished the run feeling decent and will spend the rest of the day getting in proper nutrition/hydration to be ready for a workout tomorrow.

I'm craving weird things like carrot juice and pickles."
04/09/2014,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,7.40,miles,3386,,,Kinvara 4,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Macalester Track - 8:30am

Met up with Jon Peterson to do this workout.  The original plan was 20x200, but Dennis modified it to 16 after I ran 11 of them.  

I went into this workout decently tired, but once I got moving, I was just working way too hard to try and hit these times.  Peterson dropped out at 9 due to a tight calf and then I just started to peter off.  

I believe I have accidentally entered the dreaded Valley of Fatigue.  It's pretty disappointing that my body can't keep up and recover fast enough, but I'm happy that I'm still healthy.  I just feel flat as all get out.  As a consequence, Dennis prescribed a day off tomorrow followed by a couple really easy days to try and get myself back on track.

Either that or I could go see Dr. Brown....

Anyway, I mentioned to Dennis that I had been craving carrot juice and pickles, and he too called me pregnant.  Thanks Jake.  Can't someone else vouch for me here for weird cravings!?"

The plan this morning was to do 6x800 on the track, but I really didn't feel optimistic going into it.  I warmed up and my legs still felt like 10 pounds of crap in a 5 pound bag, so Dennis called off the workout for me and is pushing it until tomorrow.  To be honest though, I don't know if just one more day will be enough though.

After warming up with Jon, he went off to do the workout and I went and walked another 4.3 miles.  My legs just felt so bad.  I'm starting to wonder if I'm a little anemic, so I pounded a bunch of asparagus and kale when I got home.  Hopefully that perks me up a bit."

A pretty below average workout.  I'm feeling much better than I did yesterday, but this type of workout should be cake.  Instead I was pushing to make it happen.  Still trudging around in the Valley of Fatigue.

Morning slog with Nick Ross.  Dennis told me to keep my heart rate below 140.  My legs just felt like total crap.

Went and picked up some iron after the run thanks to Nick Ross and his expertise on iron supplementation due to his prestigious bio degree. Maybe a long shot, but I'm hoping it helps pop me out of this funk.

[EDIT:] Nick Ross and his prestigious degree also suggested the classic pizza and beer binge.  Run really hard before hand so that the body desperately wants nutrients, and then jam pack pizza down your pie hole until the brink of puking, which essentially jams the calories and grease into every corner of the body.  I forget the recovery role that the beer played."

Felt a little better this morning.  At least was able to manage 7min pace with relative comfort, but I still don't feel normal.

Started taking an iron supplement with vitamin C.  Also went to get my blood drawn after this run to get it analyzed.  Should have the results tomorrow."

Morning trot.  There are two small inclines on this run, and on each one, my legs lacked any resemblance of spring.  Just felt like two dangling limbs that were going to give way.  I would say it's a similar feel to the last lap of a 5k....except that I hadn't done anything remotely difficult before it.

I'm really hoping to get these blood test results today and they have some sort of reason as to why I feel so terrible.  Otherwise I'm not sure where to go from here."

Lovely Minnesota weather we're having.  Went rain-->sleet-->hail-->snow-->hail-->sleet-->snow, or something like that.  Getting pelted in the face with hail just felt awesome.

It was like some irresponsible teenager knocked over the slushie machine at Speedway and it spilled all over the floor.  And then I decided it would be a good idea to run 5 miles on it."

Starting to finally feel more normal again.  Haven't heard back from the doc on the blood tests, but this is day #4 on iron supplements and I'm feeling better.  And if it's the placebo effect, I don't care--it's working.

Also, Minnesota thought it would be funny to dump snow overnight, so I ran through 2-3' of freshly laid soppy wet thick white blanket."

Feeling pretty normal again on easy runs, which is just great.  Still no blood test results yet (supposed to only take a day...), but I've been feeling better each day with taking this iron supplement.

Also ran on the pedestrian path next to the creek for the first time since.....November?  All the snow is melting, along with my lingering hatred for Minnesota spring."

Got my blood test results back.  Technically my ferritin levels were 'normal' at 39, as anything above 30 is considered fine.  But I've heard from multiple sources that many distance runners don't feel well unless it is over 50 or 60.  So I'm going to keep popping the iron supplement since it's been making me feel so much better.

Pretty good long run.  Still not back to feeling normal, but getting there.  Ran the first 11 at a mildly easy pace, and then picked it up the last 4 miles to 5:43, 5:39, 5:33, 5:42.  The last mile was a little uncomfortable with my breathing, but other than that it all felt pretty solid."

Showed up and wasn't sure what the workout was.  Warmed up and then Dennis arrived at the track.  We then spent a few minutes going back and forth about what would be an appropriate workout to get my legs moving but not 'put too much into them.'  

We settled on the ol' faithful 8-10 quarters with 60s recovery...who would have guessed?

Confidence was a little shaky going into this workout on account of having felt so poor lately with this iron deficiency getup, but once I got moving, I felt pretty good and the effort to maintain this pace was much easier than a few weeks ago.  Granted I've basically tapered for the last week, but I felt like I could actually change gears at will.  I felt normal again.  The workout wasn't anything to write home about, but it was nice to be able to hit these paces with relative comfort again."

Met with with superstar Nick Ross for an early morning shag.  Or something like that.

We pranced through the woods of the bird sanctuary and Nick Ross told me for the second time in two weeks how much he wished he had a 5 mile route that was just in the woods like the 3/4 mile stretch in the bird sanctuary.  Little does he realize how good Minneapolites have it compared to other city dwellers in America.

After dropping him off at his joint, I added a lap around Calhoun and then zipped home.  Quads are still a little sore, but overall legs are feeling good.

1500 tomorrow.  My first race since July 4th, 2013.  Almost 10 months.  Also my first 1500 since 04/16/2011.  Over 3 years.  Should be a doozy."

My first race in 10 months and my first 1500 in 3 years.  Nothing to really write home about, but it was a decent rust buster.

Had jello legs halfway through and was feeling pretty rusty on racing.  It had been a while since I tried to push myself that hard and it certainly felt like it.  I'm really glad we got this out of the way before heading out to Payton Jordan next weekend.  I'm hoping that now that I've blown out the tubes a bit that I feel better next weekend.

Followed up the workout with 3x150m all out, walk back recovery.

My first race with Team USA MN under Dennis Barker and my first with Saucony.  Time to move on up.

Solo workout along the river road path in the rain and wind.  A pretty solid workout considering the conditions.  I wish I could have felt a little more relaxed, but I was fighting the elements.  That taken into consideration, Dennis thinks this was a pretty strong workout.

Felt like I had some pop in my legs and like I could finally change gears again--like I could actually needed to.

On another note, I am a straight up idiot and won't be going to Payton Jordan.  Instead I'll be racing a 1500m at Hamline this weekend and then the TC 1 Mile on Thursday in MPLS."

It is my first speed workout in a while, so I know I just need to get those anaerobic systems in place to handle this type of work load.  I'm hoping this serves as a good tuneup for this weekend's 1500 and next week's TC 1 Mile so I don't get beat by Nick Willis by 15+ seconds."

Easy run with Ben and Lance.  We tried to get to Pike Island via the dog park at Hiawatha, but no cigar with all the flooding there and our run turned into some sort of adventure race through the woods, including crossing a creek on a fallen tree.

Then we jumped back up to the path and tried to get to Pike Island....only to find that the bridge was under water, so we just danced around Ft. Snelling Park before heading back. 

We did run into a bunch of army guys doing a time trial (I assume 3 miles) and we were running by where they were finishing.  I thought they were going start yelling at us to sprint the last 100, it was pretty funny.  Those guys are intense."

I get sucked into trying to hold 5 minute pace because then everything's even, but that was probably a tad too quick this morning for how I felt.  I was fine through 2, but then had to work the last 6-7 minutes.  I just wished that had felt more comfortable.

It was warm out and I ran shirtless and almost perspired.  Almost.  It was so nice.  Ran past the U of M ladies on the warmup and we exchanged short pleasantries.  It's safe to say my tempo increased a bit during those hundred meters as I waved hello back.

Felt really good on the track--Dennis said to run fast but not strain.  We both expected 27-28 range, so to hit 25-26 feeling good made for a confidence booster on the track.  Left achilles a bit buggy after the last one, but keeping an eye on it."

Dishearteningly, the TC 1 Mile got cancelled due to lighting, which was a total bummer.  I was really looking forward to the chance to race all those guys. 

Instead we met for a workout and Peterson and I got after it.  This was easily the best workout I've had since moving to MN.  I felt so smooth on the first mile.  It was a great confidence booster for the Oxy 5k next week.

Met with Jeff See (also an Ohioan and half-blood Cincinnatian) and went for an easy long run.  Left achilles was pretty touchy after the hard workout in spikes last night and didn't warm up until about mile 5.  Just need to stay on top of my eccentrics and massage to keep in under control.

Was decently tired by the end of this.  I didn't have much time for nutrition between last night's awesome workout and this morning's run.  Only squeezed in a big sandwich last night so I was feeling drained by the end of this run.

Really interesting discussion during the run, including the financial woes even someone like Jeff (who's with Saucony elite, was 2011 US Indoor Mile Champ, and a 3:35 guy) go through.  In his words, 'If we didn't have to worry about the whole money thing, the running lifestyle is just awesome.'  But then reality has to get in the way."

Small crew at Macalester and did this workout with Peterson.  Ran in the A6 instead of spikes to save my achilles a bit and was happy with how it felt today.  Felt much better than Friday overall and handled the workout pretty well.

Workout felt nice and relaxed--hitting those 64s just seemed to be on auto-pilot.  Jon and I alternated leads every 2 reps.  Running Thursday's workout and today's workout with him side by side helped boost my confidence since he's run in the 13:40s twice this season already.

This has me thinking a little more aggressively about Oxy on Thursday.  Perhaps 13:30 isn't out of the question.  Word on the street is that Willis has asked to go through 3k in 8:00-8:05, which is 13:20-13:27ish, so if I can ride the back of that train to glory, it would be a really good night.  We shall see--I feel like what I'm able to run in the 5k is a huge toss up right now."

Easy run with Ben, Heather, and Dani (!!!!!).  It was awesome to see Dani running again after so many injury woes.  We took it nice and easy and pace was all over the place for the first few miles while Ben lead the charge through some dodgy creek path.  

We dropped the ladies off at 6 and then Ben and I cruised the rest of the run in the mid 6:40s.  Achilles felt pretty good today, was a little touchy here and there, but overall solid.  

Like Dennis said, if I can just keep my achilles healthy, I should have a pretty big race here soon."

Easy jaunt through the rain. Once I got to Isles there was a girl running on the cow path next to the bike path while I ran on the cow path next to the running path.  We were almost going the same speed and we both peeked a couple of glances at each other.  I didn't recognize her.

I went out of my way to take the much larger radius on a couple of turns to try and gauge how much slower she was going than me and considered joining her, but then finally decided she was probably 7:15ish and that was a little slower than I really wanted to trot.

That or I'm just afraid to talk to girls."

84� at race time, even at 10:40 at night, and it showed.  What also showed up in a big way was my lack of consistent training on that third mile.  I faked it through the first two, but then that last mile (estimated at ~4:37) was a combination of the heat and my injury woes over the winter.

Overall a disappointing race, especially when you look at the clock, but I did beat a couple of guys who have run pretty fast, and some of those who have done so this season.  I'd estimate the race was 10-15 seconds slow due to the heat, so that puts me close to my PR in ideal conditions.  That's great and all to think about, but mid 13:40s isn't going to get me very far on the professional scene.  

I am happy that I pulled this off after only about 2 months of training, but it's the competitor in me that wants a lot more.  I'm just not sure if it's going to happen this year (at least on the track).

At the end of the day though, I'm finally getting into the right races.  Was I where I wanted to be? No. But now I finally have the chance to be with being in the right races. It will come with time.

Easy run with Travis.  We tried running to the Hollywood Sign, but our hopes were quickly dashed after about 4 miles when we were both exhausted from going up and down on loose sand (horse path) through Griffith Park.  We shut it down in the park and returned to the road for the flats.  By about 45 minutes I was already toast having only 10 hours between the race last night and the run this morning. As soon as we got back to the hotel I called it quits and Travis added on a bit."

Easy long run with Travis and Jon Grey after helping out at the TC Kids XC Fun Run at Como Park.  Didn't get much sleep last night again after getting home from the airport at 1am and then being at the park at 9am.

Regardless, this was still a solid run.  And might be the one day of the year where I can say with 100% confidence the weather was better in Minneapolis than it was in LA. It was 65�, low humidity, and sunny.  Just made for amazing running weather.

Dropped Travis off after 8, then Jon and I added on 7 more and picked up the pace a bit.  Achilles was sore from the race yesterday, but felt pretty good today."

Easy solo run around the lakes.  These are the weekends that justify people living in this frozen wasteland.  It was 70�, sunny, low humidity, low winds.  Every single person in the city was jammed on the lake paths, which made running a little more difficult with a bob and weave, but I really wasn't that mad about it.

Did this with Peterson and Sathre.  Having company made this threshold much easier than the last one that I did solo.

Wow this was tough.  One of the hardest workouts I've had in a long time.  Goal was to stay at/under 4 minute mile pace for the whole thing, except at the beginning where Dennis wanted us to ease into it (thus the 77).  

On the 4th set I thought I was dead.  Didn't know if I'd make the 5th set, but having Peterson there really helped to sack up on the last set.  He pulled away from me on the last two sets, but only slightly.  I was a little surprised that I was able to maintain on the last set because I could barely feel my legs anymore.

Finished by collapsing on the track.  When Dennis asked what I thought and I told him that I thought it was harder than a race, he responded, 'Good, that's how it should have felt.'"

Showed up and DBark gave us the option of either a 5k workout today and 800 workout early next week, or vice versa.  Peterson and I both took no time at all to decide on the 800 workout.  Both of us were still pretty toast from Tuesday.

I would say this workout went pretty well for heavy legs: I PR'd in both the 200 and 300.  Maybe one day I'll finally be able to break 25 for a 200.

Went into this workout with somewhat heavy legs still, even after a few easy days. Dennis suggested pushing it off until tomorrow, but I just wanted to get it done.

Fortunately, it went much better than the feeling in my legs would have indicated.  The rain picked up during the workout and by the end my flats were soaking wet and much heavier than when I started.  Perhaps justification for slowing down a little bit?

Either way, a solid workout that was a lot easier than I thought it would be.  I am still a little haunted from how much I had to go to the well last Tuesday, so this was much easier to handle and I'm happy with how it went."

Easy run with Nick Ross. We ran Isles for potential talent, despite the overcast skies. Mostly disappointing until we got to the very far side of the lake and saw what should have been a cover model in a swimsuit that belonged on a Mexican beach.  Pretty much made the run.

Then we got to Calhoun to add on a bit and were actually passed. By a girl. Going 6:45s or so. And she passed us, she even turned her head and locked eyes with me for the briefest of moments.  We then spent the next 400m debating about whether we should keep even on the pace and swallow our pride or let our puffed out chests get the best of us.

200m later Nick Ross drops the hammer to 5:50s and we buzz by this girl, put ~50m on her, and then pull off the path to head home.  We're so cool.

Easy morning trot with Ben Kampf, Meghan, Peterson, and Luke.  Trail was a little sloppy the first mile and then it was pretty nice and dry for the next few miles.  When we hit mile four, it was mud up to the middle of our shins and we tried to push through that section to get to the next dry section, but we were cut off by a tributary, so we flipped it around after successfully coating ourselves up to our knees in brown.

Added on two miles on the end on the greenway to make it 10.

Threshold session with Peterson on the track.  It was pretty warm out (for MN, about 90�) and there was no respite from the sun. Not used the heat just yet, but that's why Dennis had us do this workout in the afternoon.

This was a really weird session.  Threshold pace just felt really awkward.  At first I wanted to go a lot faster, and then by the end I still wanted to go a little faster, but it was a pretty good ache.  Dennis was putting the reigns on and wanted us to hit 3:45 or so on each one.  We did a pulse check after each rep and I was steady at ~175."

Easy solo run.  Threw up after dinner last night from something funky I ate and then had protein shakes the rest of the night for nutrition, so I felt a little weak on this run.  Had to actually stop and walk around 3.5 for a few minutes and stretch because I was light headed.

After that I decided to scale it back from 8 and then just jogged home.  Surprisingly I felt the best the last two miles after my sissy walk."

Workout with Peterson this morning on the track.  Still a little heavy from Friday and it was pretty humid out this morning, but a solid workout considering the conditions.  

Dennis said we worked a little too hard on the mile, so to keep the pace right there on the 1200 and 800 instead of picking it up closer to 3k RP.  Overall though, I didn't have to dig too deep on this workout and am pretty happy with how it went.

Holy crap.  I don't know where this came from.  I ran 3:52 for the 1500 earlier this year.

Going into this, I just felt so good and relaxed. My legs actually felt rested for the first time in a while. Comparing this to how I felt at Oxy, I now realize how tired my legs were going into that 5k.  Tonight I had finally laid off the gas enough to feel good going into a race.  And boy did it pay off.

The rabbit before the race claimed he was going to go through 800 in 1:55-1:56, so on the first lap, everyone sort of let Leo and the rabbit go because I don't think anyone was eyeballing a 3:50.  But then when we came through in 62 on the first lap (granted it was long at 409), everybody sort of kicked into gear and we closed the gap on Leo real quick.  Major props to my roommate Daniel Herrera for leading that charge.  

Made up the slack on the second lap and came through 800 in 2:00.  I was feeling really good and ran into a little traffic on the backstretch, but when we came through 1000 in 2:30, I knew that I was going to break four because I felt so good.  We passed the clock with a lap to go in 3:01 (I thought it had said 3:00), and I knew I could close in at least 59.

I kept chilling through the turn behind a pack of about 5 that started to bunch up and then realized I felt way too good to just be sitting, so I moved out to lane 3 and shifted gears to pull even with Manzano, which in my mind I was thinking, 'Holy crap, holy crap, you're actually pulling even with this guy.'  

Ran the final turn in lane 2 like a complete freshman and then hit the final straight and started edging in front of Manzano.  Then Hamish Carson started pulling up on the inside and tucked my head down a bit and tried to turn on the after burners.  With 10 meters to go, I looked up and saw I was going to break 4 and was totally psyched.  It was only in the final stride that I realized I could actually win the thing, so I leaned to barely get the win by 0.01. 

So pumped I barely slept that night.

Long run with 10-12 miles @ sub-LT from Peterson's house.  Felt really good through 8, but then started to fall apart at 8.5, so I called it at 10 and then we just ran super easy back to his house.

A pretty good workout today.  Harder than I thought it would be.  Going into it, I thought that both JP and I could cruise this workout with relative comfort, but we both ended up having to fight a little to get through.

Dennis mentioned afterwards that perhaps a bit of the long run was still in our legs.  Then he went back and looked at when he's prescribed this workout before and said retroactively that we had a really good workout because our rest was shorter than he's ever prescribed before.

Keep it light and easy the rest of the week and hope for something special on Sunday."

Race recap stolen from my blog <a href='http://ericfinanruns.blogspot.com/2014/06/lessons-in-portland.html'><b><u>here</u></b></a>:

The pacer was erratic the first mile, as the first 800 was covered in 2:14, the next in 2:09, resulting in a mile split of 4:23.  At this point I was feeling decent, but was having a hard time getting into the psyche of a real race.  The next couple of laps clicked by and I found myself getting gapped by the pack ahead of me, yet my legs were stuck on cruise control around 67 seconds per lap.  Every time I tried to switch gears to try and close the gap on the pack, my legs gave a sluggish response and refused to respond to my mind�s urgings.  I believe I split 8:46 or so at two miles, meaning that my second mile ended up being a rather lackadaisical 4:33.

The gap slowly increased over the next few laps paralleling my decreasing mental focus on finishing hard.  It was like my mind and legs were both slowly turning simultaneously into sludge and only a small part of my sub-conscious ineffectively fought back.

Finishing in 13:47.83 is still my second best time ever, and this after only 3.5 months of consistent training; a far cry from my 3 continuous years of training leading up to my PR race of 13:44.91.  It�s also a long way from the 13:32.00 I had set my sights on to achieve the �A� standard and get an auto-qualifier for the US Outdoor Championships.

<u>Additional non-blog notes:</u>
Maybe with being sick, I tapered a little too much the couple days before (trying to run easy in order to get healthier faster), and that resulted in my legs feeling so off?  Something to consider.

Was going to try and go 12 at pace, but wasn't feeling that great and I'm still coming off this cold, so I throttled it back to 10 to play it a little more conservatively.  Breathing was more labored than usual the whole time, perhaps due to the lingering effects of this cold.

Dennis backed off the workout a bit for both Jon and me.  My legs are still feeling pretty junky.  This should have felt really smooth and effortless, but my breathing was off and much harder than it should have been.

Not sure why my legs are still feeling like crap.  Doing everything I can to get them back to normal.  Took a two hour nap following this workout and am eating a huge bowl of kale salad at each meal.  Taking my iron supplement and plenty of water.

06/27/2014,12:00 PM,Run,Race,8.00,miles,3000,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"US Outdoor Champs 5k - 9:25pm

My first US National Championships�a time to line up against guys I had competed against during college, guys I�ve watched at world championships, and even guys for whom I�ve stood in line for an autograph (mainly Bernard Lagat)!  And even coming out of the race with a 10th place showing and a new PR of 13:41 (formerly 13:44 from 2011), I must admit disappointment, but only the most disappointment one is allowed when setting a new PR.  Of course I�m thrilled to finally knock a few seconds off my 5k time after three years of injury and frustration, stoked to have competed and placed top 10 in a national championship, but it was the story line that unfolded during the race rather than the results which is the root of my dismay. A video of the race can be found here.

At no point during the race did I feel that I was in the race.  The entirety of the race from my perspective was just hanging on by a thread to the lead pack which surged and slowed in the mildly windy conditions and relatively slow first half.  With each ebb and flow propagating and exaggerating itself throughout the bulk of the pack, I was caught on the tail end of the accordion, fighting on each backstretch to keep contact and finding myself backing off the gas on the homestretch.

As the race began to pick up the last mile, I was able to consciously make moves around those who were dropping off, but I never really felt like a competitor in the lead pack�and it is in that where I find my greatest disappointment.

Coming into race week, my legs had been feeling pretty fatigued from the intensity of our training and I was without much of an explanation as to why I was so energy poor.  My best guess is cumulative training fatigue in combination with the illness my body had to fight last week which left me searching for that �pop and spring� so desperately desired during race week.  As my college coach pointed out in an encouraging email to me, �If you run a PR when everything is perfect, that is to be expected.  If you run a PR when things aren�t quite right, that is a much better accomplishment.�

Yet with all that being said, as my close friend Ricky Lupp reminded me in a phone call the afternoon of the race, �It�s crazy to think that on Jan 1 you weren�t even running, and now you�re in the national championships.�  And more truthfully is that my training didn�t resume until March 1.  My coach, Dennis Barker, remarked after the race that two months ago if he had proposed I could be 10th at the national championships, I would have told him to stop dreaming.

If anything, I feel that this performance is an encouraging introduction to the runner I can blossom to be under the careful guidance of Dennis, the support of Team USA Minnesota, and the support of Saucony.  Now that Dennis and I have begun to figure each other out with the coach/athlete relationship and have been in a training good rhythm for four months to bring me to a new 5k PR, I am supremely confident that with additional consistent training under his tutelage that some very exciting things can happen."
06/28/2014,12:00 PM,Run,Normal,15.00,miles,6006,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"American River Trail - 8:42am
JP and I picked up Ben Kampf and then headed to the American River Trail in downtown Sacramento to meet up with some of JP's college buddies.  Little did we know we were crashing the Oiselle group run.  Showed up and there were about 30 of them birdies all over the place.

As soon as we got going, JP pulled away with some other people and then Ben and I ended up running together, pulling away from the chick flock.  Was really nice catching up with Ben during the run.  After about 6 miles, JP came back when his buddies turned around and then joined us for the rest of the run.

Honestly my legs felt pretty good--probably the best they did all week.  Finished with a bit of a stomach ache from being so hungry all morning, but smanged on some food post run and then sat out in the sun getting my bronze on at the meet."

Legs seemed to still have a little in them from this past week and still not feeling quite normal, but I'm feeling good about them trending in the right direction.  Excited for the 3k on Saturday!!

Stolen from my blog, which can be found <a href='http://ericfinanruns.blogspot.com/2014/07/racing-in-belgium.html?m=1'><b><u>here.</u></b></a>

My first international race and my first international win! On Saturday Jon Peterson and I raced the 3000m the Memorial L�on Buyle race in Oordegem, Belgium.  I was very pleased to come out with the win and a new PR of 7:54.18 (previously 7:59 from 2011). Race video can be found <a href='http://www.vimeo.com/100023083'><b><u>here.</u></b></a> 

Going into the race, my legs had felt like they have the past two weeks or so: decent, but still sore. It's difficult to explain properly, but the best thing I can come up with is how one's legs feel the day after a hard workout.  The kind of ache during the next day's run where the soreness just lingers from mile one right to the end.  I'm still wishing that my legs would come back under me and feel the way they did for the Adrian Martinez Classic (the mile race I ran a month ago), but Dennis comically remarked, 'Keep feeling bad if you keep winning.'

The start line was pretty aggressive with a large field.  I was sharing lane three and the guy to my inside blocked me out like he was protecting the paint in a basketball game when the gun went off.  I quickly fought back to find position through the first turn and popped up right behind Chris Solinsky in 5th place by 200m right on the rail. 

The next few laps were pretty dull with the exception of another competitor trying to cut in front of me to get on the rail and cut me off.  Each time he tried to move in even though there was no room, I put my hand out on his side and gently held him off as I was already running right up on Solinsky.

Our third lap was a 65 (we wanted 62-63 per lap) and Jon Peterson came rolling up on my shoulder and sat for about 200m and then we decided to move.  He gave me a signal and went to the front we me in tow.  We rolled up on the rabbit and started to pass him, so he went wide as we came through the mile in 4:14.

Jon took the next lap through in 62, I then swtiched leads with him and hit the split, then he took back over with 600 remaining.  With 500 to go, another competitor ended up splitting us so I came into the bell lap in third, but still feeling like I had more in the tank, despite the lingering soreness in my legs.  On the backstretch I was able to shift gears to move into first and then keep things moving on the homestretch to pull away for the win.  Last lap was about a 58-59, which I'm happy with, but know that I need to be able to close faster in championship style races.

Overall I'm very pleased with the race, and am most happy with how Jon and I ran tactically together the last mile to pick up the pace and control the race. Although I must admit I feel that there is a lot more in the tank and that I could be running faster if I could get my legs to feel good for races. Yes, I'm setting PRs, but it's because I'm easily in the best shape of my life, not that I'm fully reaching my potential in each race. As I have mentioned previously, the way my legs feel now may be due to this being my first full training cycle under a new coach and a new program. It feels so similar to my first year of college. I can only be optimistic about how things will pan out the next few years so long as health and consistency is on my side."

Jon and I pushed back our long run until we got into Amsterdam to sleep in a little bit longer at the hostel in Brussels.

Once we got to Amsterdam we grabbed some coffee and then went out.  First we ran to some part (Sloterdijkermer) that appeared to be some sort of Old Town in the middle of it with quaint little houses and tiny gravel roads.  It was pretty interesting.  We then went out west of the city out about 5 miles and it was really beautiful.

I was pretty pleased with how this workout went.  It was raining pretty well during our workout and there was a little bit of wind.  The track at the Univesity was also awesome--the widest track I've ever been on.  The straights were only about 50-60m long with huge turns.

Legs are starting to feel a little better as compared to the junk they've been feeling for the last few weeks since getting sick at Portland.  Starting to get excited for this mile on Sunday.  Dennis wants me to go out in 58 and hang on.  He thinks I can run 3:55."

After a 13 hour travel day getting all the way up to the northwestern part of Ireland (...not Northern Ireland), we finally arrived at the 'Artist's Hostel', which overlooks the track. Very interesting place complete with talking parakeet at the entrance, Jamaican artist who runs the place, cots from the 1970s, and awfully powerful room scent plug-ins, which I can only assume covers up something even worse.

Had a heck of a time getting here, but eventually got a ride from Danny McDaid, a two time Irish Olympian and 2:13 marathoner. Didn't know it until after the fact though.

Easy shakeout this morning and looking forward to this race. Hamish Carson was telling us this morning that he talked to the rabbit and requested 2:56 through 1200. If we could do that and close hard, it should make for a heck of a race. Post race festivities around the World Cup final should be pretty entertaining as well."

Well this was embarrassing. Not really sure what the deal was with today. Dennis told me he thought I was ready for 3:55, so to go out in 58 and make it happen. So I tried to do just that....and fell far short. Just no steam after 600m. 

I want to write something introspective and encouraging (to myself) here, but I really got nothing.

A 'win', and a PR. Pretty good race and happy to PR, but as Dennis said, I'm sort of nibbling away and we were both hoping I'd take a bigger bite.  Guess it just wasn't in the cards for the night.

Easy long run with JP, Ali Hamdi (Belgian 1500 runner), and Hamish Carson (New Zealand national champ at 1500).

Was still dehydrated from the night before and it was pretty humid out this morning, so not the most comfortable long run.  Hamish peeled off early and then the rest of us finished it out.  We eased off the accelerator for the last couple of miles though since none of us felt all that great.

On the rolling hills course by DBark's house.  He wanted them approximately at 10k pace, which was aptly named 'Bix 7 Pace' for the day.

Felt better than I had anticipated due to a late lunch, jet lag, recent race, and poor nutrition.  Held things pretty well for the first 4, but then let JP go a bit on the last one because I was pushing a little too hard.

Dennis wanted me to pick it up if I felt good, but it just wasn't there to go any faster today.  Plus I was a bit concerned about doing a longer harder workout with Monday mile repeats on deck.

About 2 miles in I got a side stitch that was pretty bad, but I did what most runners do--just sucked it up and ran through it.  After about mile 6 or 7 it mostly went away and I was able to pick up the pace and finish sub-6 the last couple of miles feeling decently relaxed.

Post-run, that stitch came back with a vengeance. I had shooting pain just with twisting or bending over. It was debilitating. What's wrong with me? I took some naproxen to try and ease the pain and get through the rest of the day, but I really had to take it easy and not do a whole lot of moving."

Easy solo run once I got back from Green Lake.  I waited until evening to do it hoping that my side would feel better, but I'm still having shooting pain in my side right underneath my right ribcage and the pain moves laterally.

Took a naproxen before the run and then sort of just jogged around.  Didn't feel that great, but I needed to do something."

Was supposed to do mile repeats on grass this morning, but Dennis called it off on account of my side pain. I was able to get in some more easy miles today, but I think that was only allowed by the pain numbing effects of the naproxen I took pre-run.

Travis thinks it may be a strained oblique or intercostal. I go in to get treatment on Wednesday and maybe he can work his magic.

Talk about feeling like a wuss: I can't work out because.....my side hurts?"

Started out with JP, but then he had sub-LT, so he took off after two miles.  I was feeling pretty good with the cool crisp weather (I even wore a shirt during the run), so I gradually and naturally picked it up as well with the last 5 or so around 6 flat pace.

Side still bothersome, not improving. Definitely the limiting factor to my running at the moment. Hoping Travis can help me tomorrow."

Ran with JP, Gina, and Ben today. Side was pretty bothersome, definitely worse than yesterday. I think I got too aggressive yesterday when working on my motorcycle trying to torque off some bolts and utilized my abs too much and paid for it today. Last couple of miles were pretty painful.

Went and saw Travis later in the day and he did some ART on my side. His guess is a strained oblique. I feel like such an idiot."

3.9 mile c/d in 27:34

My side felt much better than yesterday. It really didn't even bother me until about the last two miles of the cooldown, and even that was much better than yesterday.  I was pretty pumped about that because I really thought I was going to be unable to workout at all.

Ran the hills with JP and we got a good session in. I just gotta shake this strained oblique and then dive into a good training block."

Ran flat 200s on the path down by the valley below Minnehaha Falls. Slightly downhill going out, slightly uphill coming back.

Our warmup turned into a Ben Kampf style trail run excursion jumping rocks and dodging roots everywhere. Decided that was enough of that and we hit the riverside greenway for the cooldown.

73� with a dewpoint of 70�, so it felt like a bucket of mugginess as we did the workout.  Didn't feel all that peppy going into it, but was surprised that I hit a bunch of 30s for the workout. This mainly serves the purpose to try and zip things up a bit before the Minnesota Mile on Sunday. We'll see what I can salvage of my fitness there."

I finally decided that doing this loop clockwise was sort of like cheating since the last two miles along Cedar Lake North Trail were slightly downhill and I didn't have to work as hard at the end of my sub-LT miles.  So today I finally manned up and ran the loop in reverse, meaning that my warmup miles were slightly downhill and the first few miles of my sub-LT were uphill. Made for a better training stimulus and the last few miles on the Midtown Greenway actually felt pretty easy since they are pancake flat compared to the slight roll of the Cedar Lake North trail.

Weather was gorgeous today and I felt much better than I had anticipated the day after the race. Cool and breezy which helped keep my heart rate lower and prevented me from looking like a sweaty pig. The effort was much easier than last week and I felt so good that I went 13 miles at pace instead of 12. Picked it up towards the end since I was feeling so good. It would be better if I could just run in the low 5:30s for the whole run though instead of running to the barn. I'll get to that soon. Pretty happy with today's long run.

16 hill reps up a semi-decent hill. Not as steep as it should have been, but it was the best I could find. Glad I only had to go 8 today. I was riding the struggle bus on the cool down. My body didn't know what do to with all the extra heat."

Dennis wanted to tune things up a bit for this weekend's 5k and hit some VO2Max stuff before the race. Did this workout side by side with Peterson, alternating leads with each rep. It honestly felt relatively easy. Had to push a bit on the last few, but outside of that, it felt pretty good. Feeling much better than I did at the end of track season where I just felt tired all the time. I think my iron levels are finally coming back around and I'm feeling more normal."

<a href='http://ericfinanruns.blogspot.com/2014/09/progress-in-providence.html'><b><u>Blog about race here</u></b></a>

My highest finish at a USARC race, but still outside of the top 10. Race went out rather leisurely at 4:33 through the mile and everyone was bunched up. Downhill in the first mile made it feel pretty easy. Then we even split on the second mile coming through in 9:06 and I was right there with the lead pack. But then on the long straight after the mile 2 split, I lost contact with the lead group. With about 600 to go, I caught Craig Forys and moved past him into 9th place.  

Then we hit the hill with 300 to go and Julian Saad went flying by with Forys in tow, which left me outside of the top 10 and the money. Watched it happen right before my eyes and my legs couldn't do anything.  I'm glad I did this race, but it was frustrating to not be able to capitalize on such a good opportunity. It is a good sign that when I'm racing a deep field like this that I feel like I belong in the top pack and I fought my way to be in it as long as I could. Just couldn't make it all the way, yet still feel like I belong there. That's a big change in pace from the beginning of this year where I'd toe the line pretty wide eyed about some star competitors next to me. Don't give in to the pecking order.

One more race left for the fall schedule in this weird post-break, pre-training block period. Thinking about next year and how to try and reroute my schedule a little better so I don't end up with this weird racing/training mix, but it seems pretty difficult to get right when my main focus is on outdoor track."

This run was really rushed. I had to hammer this in between getting in from Boston at 4:40 and having to be at Bible study at 7:30. Got home as quick as I could via public transit and then got moving.  

Not sure if it was the urgency of the run, the focus I had to get to Bible study on time (I lead it, so I had to be there promptly), the extra nutrition and rest I had, or what, but I felt invincible. I was hardly breathing--only my legs were holding me back on the pace. Not sure how I did it the day after a race, but this was the best long run I've ever had and the best I've ever felt. I definitely could have kept going, but I was short on time so had to call it at 15.

Splits:
1 mile w/u in 6:11
5:37, 5:25, 5:25, 5:21, 5:24, 5:28, 5:25, 5:24, 5:25, 5:25, 5:20, 5:23, 5:17, 5:10 (Average = 5:23.5 for 14 miles)
0.4 jog to c/d

Last 13.1 of the sub-LT was in 70:23. Almost snuck under 70. I felt so good."

Easy solo jaunt. Legs felt pretty good, considering that last two days. Right hip flexor and upper hammy got a little tight in the last mile, so I cooled off the pace a bit. I think they're just a bit aggravated from the long run yesterday. Seeing Travis tomorrow, so I'll have him work his magic hands on the area to break up any adhesions."

Decent sized crew today. Did the workout with JP and DStilin. Felt pretty good. Legs are still feel like they have some fatigue from the Sun/Mon combo, but this went pretty well. Eating a little greek yogurt, peanut butter, and granola appears to be helping the quality of my workouts. Sits in my stomach decently well, but could be better. If I can just figure out my pre-run nutrition, I think this fall will be an excellent block of training."

09/27/2014,12:00 PM,Run,Threshold,15.00,miles,5287,,,Fastwitch 6,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Midtown - Cedar Lake North - Kenilworth - Midtown - 7:10am

The legendary 15-10-10-5 workout today. Ran this with JP. Splits as follows:

3 mile w/u (6:52, 6:27, 6:18)
15 minutes @ threshold (4:55, 4:54, 5:00)
3 min jog (6:51/mi)
10 minutes @ threshold (5:00, 5:04)
3 min jog (7:10/mi)
10 minutes @ threshold (5:02, 5:08)
3 min jog (7:06/mi)
5 minutes @ threshold (4:58)

A pretty solid workout. JP pulled away from me a bit on the last two. I'm trying to put all of this into perspective. 

Comparing the average paces from two times I've run this workout:
9/27/14 - 4:57, 5:02, 5:05. 
11/4/13 - 5:00, 5:03, 5:08

In 2014, the previous 5 weeks of mileage to the workout averaged 67.4.
In 2013, the previous 5 weeks of mileage to the workout averaged 101.2. 

Other similar workouts: 
6/7/13 - 8 mile tempo in 5:01/mi. This workout is relatively better than the 15-10-10-5 workouts.
11/1/11 - 5 mile tempo in 4:54/mi. This came 3 days after winning the Big East XC title. Arguably best shape of life.

The reason I'm looking at all of these previous workouts is because I'm trying to find a quantifiable way to answer 'yes' to the question, 'Am I improving? Am I getting better?'

Yes, I did PR in the mile, 3k, and 5k this year, but is that because I'm more fit, or because I had better opportunities?

I'm also noticing the trend in my log that when I'm doing ~100mpw, that my aerobic fitness is definitely stronger on the longer stuff. Well no duh, that makes sense. But I'm having trouble balancing the intensity of DBark's training with that kind of volume while staying consistently healthy. After I get through the TC 10 Miler this weekend, I'll enter a new training block and hopefully will be able to work my way (safely) into the triple digits for volume again. There's a lot to be said for aerobic development at that volume level, and I just haven't been able to sustain that level for years."

09/30/2014,12:00 PM,Run,Interval,8.50,miles,3337,,,Type A6,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Macalester - 8:35am

Workout with JP and DStilin. Came into it with legs a little heavy, but it went surprisingly well and smooth. Felt really good and just clicked it down a little bit on each one.

The temperature has dropped from 80� to 40� in 36 hours here in Minneapolis. It's finally fall.

On the cooldown, there was definitely a girl checking us out hard as she walked by the track. I gave her a big cheesy smile and she grinned and looked away. If I had better vision, I could have probably her blush a little #ladyslayer.

Also, before the workout, I got a chance to talk to Dennis a little about what I wrote in my log regarding Saturday's 15-10-10-5 workout. He mentioned that he does want me running higher mileage, but there's two approaches to doing it:

1) Build up to high mileage quickly, then start to add speed to the workouts to increase volume spent at high quality aerobic stimulus.
2) Start with a lower mileage already doing a significant portion of it in the higher quality aerobic zone and then gradually increase overall volume.

He mentioned that since his focus for me is the 2016 5k, that he doesn't want to take the first approach, as it can dull natural speed the body has. Instead, he prefers to focus on the second approach, which allows for continued speed development. He feels strongly about my ability to improve my PRs in the mile and even 800, which he says will pay off big time in the latter part of a 5k. 

I feel there's a few different ways to look at it, but I will take his word for it and stick to the system. More than anything else, I just know that consistency is the biggest investment I can make to my success."

Had to get up early to do this as I followed it with 4 hours of volunteering at the kids races today that were put on by TCM. Pretty darn cold standing around handing out medals, but it was pretty good fun.

Slept in after making an airport run at 5am to drop off Emily.

Thought a lot about the next few months of training. Surprisingly not that sore after yesterday. Thinking I didn't try hard enough because I wasn't that emotionally invested in it. Or something like that, I dunno."

Warmed up an easy 2 with Nick Ross and in the process, passed Mitch Baum and said hello to him real quick on the path. Nick was hobbling around like some middle schooler who's never tried to touch his toes. Then I got moving and the weather was quite nice for a long effort. In the mid 50s with the sun shining and a slight southerly wind. This is one of my better sub-LTs I've ever done. Felt really comfortable for the first 10 of it, then started to fatigue a bit, but I really didn't strain to maintain pace.

Wooooooof. Tough run. Just didn't have it today. Felt like I was just out of fuel or something. I thought my nutrition yesterday post-workout was good, but maybe it wasn't enough. Either that, or I pushed the envelope a little too much yesterday.

In either case, today was a mental win more than a physical one. I just kept hanging in there to try and make it to 8 miles at pace.

Made it through 20, somehow. Just in a total rut these past few days. Didn't feel great at any point during the workout. But I'm still feeling healthy overall, which is a big plus. Neck was feeling a lot better too.

Weighed myself after the workout and I was 141lbs, which is about 4-5lbs down from normal base training phase, so I could be a little nutrient deficient and dehydrated. Could be why I've been feeling so down the past few days."

First few miles were a little rough, but then started to feel better. Recovery run effect achieved.

Passed a cute girl on the south side of Calhoun. Short shorts, good form, light blond hair, the whole 9 yards. Slender toned legs, with ankles that Nick Ross would die for. And she has this impeccable forefoot strike. I mean, her heels don't even consider touching the ground. I'm pretty sure her midfoot only slightly caressed the path.

So obviously seeing the opportunity, I roll up on her, ever so slowly as she's at a pretty decent clip herself, and say, 'This is going to sound weird, but wow, you have a really impressive forefoot strike'.

She looks back, slightly confused, laughs a bit, 'Uhhh, thanks?'

Just slayin' the women here in Minnesota, one by one.

She was wearing a pair of HOKAs. Maybe Merber was supposed to be the one to seal the deal."

Failed long sub-LT.

I pushed this off to the afternoon as I was involved with a thing at my church all morning, which included a delicious lunch. With that lunch was this chicken and wild rice soup that was very rich and very delicious. Well, I guess all the cream and butter that was in there just totally wreaked havoc on my system.

Felt a little off during my warmup, but then got going on the sub-LT. Only made it 5 miles, and I felt like I was going to throw up the whole time. I so badly just wanted to puke and then keep going, but I knew if I did that, then I was going to feel lightheaded from dehydration. Stuck between Scylla and Charybdis.

So after 5 miles, I laid down on the ground to try and let me stomach settle, as I knew the sub-LT for another 9 miles was out of the question. Once it settled a bit, I got up and got going again, but even at the slower pace I was really nauseous and just had phlegm and spit coming out like crazy.

Every few miles after that on the way home, I had to lay down to keep from puking. Then I tried taking a 'shortcut' and ended up getting a little lost, but luckily found Minnetonka Boulevard and took that home.

I would be ok if I never experienced that again."

Workout with JP, Jon Grey, and DStilin. Didn't really feel all that great going into this workout honestly. I'm still trying to figure out why my energy levels are down. Theories:
1. Appetite is currently suppressed, perhaps lagging behind volume increase, not enough caloric intake
2. Down a little bit on sleep the past few days (I literally have no excuses)
3. Bump up in volume

In either case, it was a solid workout, but this should have felt a lot easier than it did. Oh well, just need to keep to the grind and stay healthy. Big things will happen."

Woke up earlier to do this run, but it was 17� windchill, so I decided to sleep in longer and then do it after going to watch the MN HS State XC meet. Sort of a mistake, sort of not. Going out and standing around outside for a few hours in the cold certainly didn't help how I felt during the run. 

Plus my nutrition was all off before the run too. I keep making the mistake of having some Greek yogurt before my run, and it totally messes with my digestive track, but mostly I just have a bunch of phlegm I have to keep choking up during the run and it just sucks. So I need to figure out something else pre-run that sits better but still has equivalent nutritional value. Might have to give GenUCan a shot.

Anyways, it was my first successful long sub-LT in 3 weeks. Only had to stop briefly at mile 10 to choke up a loogie, dry heave a few times, and then keep going. I'll grade it a B- overall. Last mile my right hammy started acting up a bit and felt a little uncontrolled, so I had to back off a bit.

Another day at the salt mines. Feeling pretty fatigued today. Training accumulation is setting in, which is a good thing. I just need to stay the course and keep healthy this year. It was right about here last year that I broke down.

Since I was feeling pretty tired, I backed off a bit to make sure that I didn't cross threshold. Especially coming back up the hill on this course, it's easy to go anaerobic. After the 4th one, I started to feel more like myself and actually felt better for the second half of the workout.

Met up with Danny for a sub-LT from his place. We got going on Shepard Road and for the first 5 miles, we ran into a pretty stiff headwind. I would estimate that it probably notched back the pace 5-8 seconds/mile. Plus there were some rolling hills, which I was actually happy about since so many of my sub-LT runs are on pancake flat courses.

Ran the first 4 at pace with Danny and then I eased away a bit and ran the next 6 solo. Once I turned onto River Road at mile 6, I wasn't running directly into the wind anymore and the pace quickened at an easier effort.

Pretty happy with today considering all the accumulation I have in my legs and how tired I was yesterday. In a pretty good groove right now and just need to keep riding it for the training stimulus. If anything, I just need to keep reminding myself to ease back the effort on the harder days to make sure each workout is serving the proper purpose.

Warmed up on the indoor track there (12 laps to the mile, sharp turns) and then jumped on the treadmill for only the threshold portion to reduce time spent on the torture device. Plan was to try and make it 8 miles, but in my head I thought it would be a good day if I could make it to 6 miles @ 5 min pace.

Close. Made it 5.5 miles in 27:52 (took a bit for treadmill to get up to 5 min pace, thus the extra 22 sec). My legs were on fire and my heart rate was approaching 200 so I knew I was just trashing my body and not getting the proper stimulus, so I called it quits.

So it was either suffer another heart attack on the treadmill, or sack up and do this outside. So I swung by Nick Ross' house last night and yanked a pair of ice grippers for my shoes from him and decided I'd give the midtown greenway a go today.

Great choice. Felt way better than the treadmill. Even with wearing long tights, 4 layers, and running on top of packed snow/ice, this workout went much better than being inside on the hamster wheel. Really glad I decided to go outside. At first I thought I'd just try and suffer through 10 miles at pace, but I ended up feeling really good and went 12 at pace cutting it down. 

This was a good confidence booster. I needed it. My longer workouts as of late haven't been going too well and it was making me a little apprehensive since I'm getting ready for the US Half Champs, but this was a little confidence nudge that I needed to remind me that my fitness is coming along.

A fun race today in Cincinnati. Used GenUCAN before a race for the first time and it went pretty well. Stomach a bit upset about an hour out, but that usually happens no matter what I eat. Once I got going, I felt great.

Plan was to try and run 29:20 (4:40s), but that clearly didn't happen. I would list the splits from my Garmin, but the thing wigged out since the race and I had to do a hard reset and have lost all of my history. But from what I can remember, my Garmin read 4:42, 4:42, 4:33 for the first three miles. 

A peculiar thing about this is that typically when I wear my Garmin on a measured course, the first mile will be a little off, but then each subsequent mile is equally off from the demarcated mile point. Well, in this race, my Garmin kept beeping for the mile split further and further from the mile flags, perhaps indicating the miles were a bit long? Yes, I know Garmin's aren't accurate, but I do question the course a bit today.

In either case, I recovered pretty fast after the race and felt good on the cooldown. I need to be able to double this distance at the same pace in Houston in 7 weeks to break 63 minutes. Possible? I think so."

Meh. This was an ok workout. I was having stomach and digestion issues, and had to make a quick pitstop after 14 reps because I just wasn't going to make it through the whole workout. I must've eaten something funky today because I just felt off.

15-10-10-5. What a tough workout. Every time I run this I am just beat for the rest of the day. I again tried to run 5 min pace for the whole thing, and again fell short. Dang.

But on a good note, this was the most comfortable I felt doing the workout, even though I was unable to maintain pace. I did have to take a quick pit stop in the bushes on the 2nd 10 minute section (still sorting out my digestive issues from earlier in the week), but other than that I would say it went rather well.

Jordan Zwick joined me and ran the first 2 miles with me, then did the first mile of the second section, then finished the last 400 meters with me at the end. It was great to have his company and cheer me on. Made it go by a lot faster.

I have mixed emotions about the workout today. Typically I'd probably just go with the motions and say it was pretty decent, but I was a little downtrodden. I mean, at this fitness, 5 min pace should feel a lot easier than this. Yeah, I'm tired from the volume of work and probably from the 22 on Sat, but I really thought this workout would be easier...or at least faster than this.

Maybe I just have a lot more accumulation in my legs than I thought, but I finish workouts like this and think, 'Well gee, I want to run faster than this pace for 13.1, and without any rest. How in the world....?'"

DBark said to pick it up the second half if I felt good. I cruised the first half at a good clip so the second half I worked a little, but it was still pretty comfortable. The fact that I could do that in the middle of a 110 mile week, wearing long tights and a jacket have me feeling a little better about things.

8x400m hills @ VO2max effort. Jog back down recovery. Came into this feeling pretty worn out from the tree work yesterday, but the purpose of the workout was achieved. Was sucking some serious wind by the end of each rep up the hill. I think it was about 130-140ft vertical ascent on each rep.

Ran past another runner on my warmup, which was wild. Probably the first time I've seen another runner in New Richmond in 6 or 7 years.

Also ran past John Coyne's auto graveyard on Boot Hill.

Easy solo trot to test out the ol' calf. Right plantar was a little tight the first half mile, but other than that, the calf felt really good. 

Throughout the run my calf didn't feel tight or painful, but it did tire faster than the left and while stretching afterward it was certainly tighter. But at least it showed considerable progress since yesterday. All of my aggressive and janky home treatment did a thing or two and had in back in the black. 

Was going to double later this afternoon, but after talking it over with DBark, I'll take the afternoon off. Taking the next few days easy, seeing Dr. Yost on Monday for some ART, and thinking this thing will be cleared up by Tuesday or Wednesday for another threshold workout.

Taking tomorrow easy again and seeing Dr. Yost to see what kind of ART magic he can work on the old boy."

Ran like an idiot yesterday, paying for it today. Right calf too tight to run. Seeing Dr. Yost this afternoon. Praying that he works miracles.

On the plus side, the only tightness is high up in the calf and only muscular, so I know that it will heal fast since there is plenty of blood flow to the area and that soft tissue is easily manipulated. I just need to keep that from propagating down and bothering the achilles."

Easy solo jaunt, right calf felt better. Sore from getting beat up pretty hard yesterday at my therapy session, but definitely less tight. Didn't quite feel as good as it did last Fri/Sat/Sun though. 

Going to keep treating it pretty aggressively. DBark mentioned this morning that he'd like to touch on some threshold this weekend if my calf is up for it (just 10 mins or so) just to make sure that energy system isn't dropping off. Need to get this calf under control.

Hello 2015.

Slept in after being out a bit late last night before getting going this morning. Right calf still improving, still treating it like a madman. Hoping to be able to touch on some threshold tomorrow shortly and have my calf hold up to it. Just want to keep that energy system in the loop.

Goals for 2015:
1. Stay Healthy. Yes, a lame goal to read, but the single most important commitment I can make, as it enables the rest of this list.
2. World A Standard in the 5k (13:23)
3. Top 6 at US Outdoor Nationals in 5k
4. Top 10 Ranking in the US for 5k
5. 3:55 mile"

Woke up at 4:30 and couldn't fall back asleep. So after tossing for an hour and a half, I finally just said screw it and got up, had a cup of joe, and then hit the road.

Right calf felt pretty good today. There's still a strand that's pretty tight in the gastroc though, so I'm continuing to work that out. Keeping the miles lower until I can finish a run with no tightness at all.

Finished up with some plyos, which didn't bother my calf at all."

Main Street - New Richmond, OH - 9:26am

Did a 'workout' today and felt like a freshman. How could I get so rusty after only 11 days or so of easy running? Felt uncontrolled, slow, and uncoordinated. Felt awfully difficult to hit 5 min pace.

I did have a few extra layers of clothes on and the odd reps were into a headwind, so that accounts for a little bit of the difficulty. 

The bright and shining light though was that I got in a workout and came out of it with my calf feeling ok. It tightened up a bit, but not enough to cause any major concern. Almost threw in the towel after 4 because I was feeling so crappy, but since my calf was feeling ok, I did the two extra reps. Happy to get in 6."

The joys of winter running. It was <i>almost</i> bliss when I was running out on the long stretch on Harvey, wind at my back, fields as far as the eye could see, wind at my back. Then I turned around and was faced with about -15� windchill and that serenity quickly turned a quick death.

After a mile of a little tightness in the calf, it warmed up and honestly felt really good the rest of the run. Finished feeling a little tighter than the left, but while running, there was no local strain anymore. Very happy with the progress of the calf.

Going to do one more easy run tomorrow before a workout on Friday. Hoping I can scrap things together for Houston."

DBark wanted me to keep it shorter today to give the calf a little rest before doing a workout tomorrow. Nothing much to report. Cold, but not too cold here compared to MPLS. 4�, -13� WC.

Calf felt really good. Probably 95%. At least for an easy run. Hoping it holds up well for the workout tomorrow."

Otto Armleder - 9:00am

The Good News: calf felt great during this. A little tighter on the cooldown, but I'm definitely on my way back to 100%.

The Bad News: I can't hold 5min pace comfortably.

There was a nasty cold wind I had to battle during the workout, so that accounts for a little bit of the time, but I'm still concerned about what's going to happen in Houston next week. Oh well....I can only do what's within my control.

Just felt drained. Like I'm overtrained, or anemic. But I've just taken some rest, and I've still been supplementing with iron. I feel worn down like you would at the end of a season and I haven't even started. Or maybe I'm just being a wuss and over thinking things."

Was going to go shorter and do an 6 mile OAB on Frank Willis (what's new), but the dog that always barks like crazy between the Adamson's and the Coulson's finally pulled hard enough that he broke free. I'm assuming the heavy gage chain was connected to the tree by a thin piece of rope which snapped, allowing that vicious beast to come hurling after me on the road for 200m or so. Which gave me a very unexpected all out Usain Bolt style sprint in the middle of my run.

The dog almost got me, but then the chain that he was dragging behind him was dancing back and forth on the road and the tip caught the base of a thin metal pole supporting a mailbox, whipped around it and abruptly halted the progress of the dog before he sunk his teeth into my calf.

So, after that little episode, I decided against the out and back and the smallest loop I could make was the old high school loop."

Crazy morning. Woke up with a nasty stomach ache and writhed around for about an hour, then had to go meet some kids for this Meet the Elite event, answer some questions after pounding pepto, then crawled back into my bed in the room and pretended to go through an exorcism for the next 2 hours. I was in so much pain, it was pretty awful.

Eventually it began to subside and I threw on my shoes and got out the door. Once I got moving the stomach ache went the rest of the way away, but at this point in the day, I hadn't eaten anything except a clif bar that I had nibbled on for about an hour. So, as expected, I felt low on energy, but was able to get my run in just fine.

Following the run I was able to get down half a lunch wrap, then I had to wait another few hours before I could finally eat any more. When my appetite returned, I finally finished the rest of that sandwich wrap and had another around 4pm before having dinner at 6:30pm. What a great day to have nutrition woes."

NOTE: Also a 10 mile PR en route at 48:27.

Overall very pleased with my performance today. After my stomach nightmare yesterday, I was a little concerned coming into this, but I had no issues during the race at all.

Front pack blew away pretty fast off the line, but there was a super solid 63:20ish pack that I ran with the whole time and just stayed relaxed. In fact, I was feeling so good that at 10.5 that I made a 5k-like move and probably dropped the next 800 in 2:20 or so. Well, that was a mistake. I really should have waited until the last 800 to make such an aggressive move. I got swallowed right back up by the pack by 11.5 and then passed by a few guys. I think had I waited until the end to put the pressure on that I could have been closer to 11th place, since he was only 9 seconds in front of me, but I guess I learn to race another day. Put that nugget of wisdom in my pocket for next time.

Also had no problems with my calf, so I'm very happy to report that I'm feeling healthy and ready to take on US XC to try to make the Pan Am or World XC teams.

What's the best way to recover from a half? Do a VO2Max workout. Or something like that. 

DBark wanted to jump start the VO2Max work to try to get the legs moving for XC without putting too much into us. I would say that this workout hit that target pretty well. Altitude really didn't affect each rep until about the last 100m, but it was good to have 90s recovery over the standard 60s to catch my breath before getting moving again.

12k RP for 5,200ft. DBark took the pace that won US XC last year (4:51) and prescribed that as an opening pace and told us to pick it up from there if possible.

Did the workout on a 1k dirt loop around a lake. Pretty windy out, but it was a great location for a workout.

Felt pretty good the first few, then had to dig the last few to hold pace, especially as the wind picked up. JP and I were both pretty worn out afterward, but felt pretty good about the workout. DBark sounded a little disappointed on the phone after....but not sure why. He may have thought it was too easy because we handled it so well. He suggested post-workout that maybe we should have done 2min rest instead of 3, but it was too late to 'pologize."

Then we hit roads for the next 10 (mixture of gravel and dirt) and the wind died down as we got coverage from the foothills.

JP fell back to keep it more relaxed and I went with him for about a 1/2 mile, but then decided since I was feeling pretty good to pick it back up and run with the front pack.

Foothills Community Park - 9:10am

Ran this workout on grass with JP and Andy Wacker. It was windy as all get out. I couldn't believe how often the wind kept changing directions and would gust up to probably 30-35mph. Most of the odds reps were into the wind, while most of the even reps were with the wind, but that wasn't always the case.

Anyway, it was good to spike up and get back on grass. Feeling pretty good about this workout as a tuneup. Planning to run the Flatirons Winter Classic XC 4 Miler on Saturday as a rust buster for next weekend.

Tune-up race before USA XC next weekend. It was really good to get this race in and get a feel for racing at altitude. Andy Wacker took the race out and right after the first mile, Joe Gray made a decent move to the front and I followed him and it strung out pretty fast. Sean Quigley sat on my shoulder for the 2nd lap as I maintained distance with Joe Gray. Right as the 3rd lap began, Quigley put a little move on me and pulled away and then he and Joe both put a bit of distance on me. I could have dug a little deeper and fought to stay up, but I treated this race sort of like Regionals the week before NCAAs and didn't want to play all my cards.

With 400 to go, I closed the gap on the two ahead and was only ~10 sec behind Joe and ~5 sec behind Sean. Feeling pretty good about that result as those two were 4th and 5th, respectively, as US XC last year. Especially with having a higher volume week with Tues-Thur being big days and coming into the race tired, I'm pleased with the result. Rest up some more next week and get ready for 12k!

Side note: I also tried taking a concentrated beet shot 3 hours out from the race. It was absolutely terrible and I gagged on the last 1/2oz of it and almost threw up. Made stomach a little upset, but not too bad. Debating on whether to give it another go for next weekend."

Fairview HS - 9:10am - 5,400ft

JP and I had different workouts prescribed by DBark today, so Andy Wacker jumped in with me for this since he also wanted to do some quarters before this weekend.

Pretty decent workout, wish it felt easier. Although this is the type of workout I would use to tune up for a 3k or 5k typically, rather than a 12k. DBark just wanted me to do it as he wanted to replicate a pre-race workout that has worked for me in the past.

Got pretty windy on the last 4 and had to dig on the homestretch, but Wacker would pace me through the first 200 and then get out of the way. Excited to give this weekend a solid shot.

On our cooldown, Ben True showed up and started his workout. Gave him the stinkeye during my plyos, but I don't think he noticed. Surprise."

Well, I've been putting off writing about this, so here goes:

Very warm and very sunny. Record high for the day was 74�, we had 72� at the start line and underneath the glaring sun, the 'real feel' was 80�. Very unusual for a February day.

Got off the line quick only to find myself in the lead by a couple of strides 100m in. I tuned it down a bit and was still in the lead. It seemed as if the lead pack didn't want to get moving--like everyone was asleep. Went like this for about 600m before Andy Wacker came roaring by and decided to get into race mode, which essentially woke everyone up and I got swallowed up....then spit out. The top pack was just a little out of my comfort zone, knowing that I had 12k to run.

Came through the first lap probably in about 40th place or so, and then tried to settle in. Well, there wasn't a whole lot of comfort zone finding I was doing at 5,400ft apparently, because I never really found a good spot. My legs felt like rubber after the first lap and that feeling of being unable to tell your legs to spring forth and make moves never really went away. Perhaps I tapered too much? Were my two weeks leading into the race too much of a bounce in mileage over the previous 6 weeks? All questions I have been asking myself.

Ending up moving up steadily throughout the race, but especially on the last lap I picked off the stragglers, which really didn't mean much because those people were the ones who actually had the balls to go with the top group and give themselves a shot. I sort of settled for mediocrity I suppose. But it was honestly the best I had on the day. I can't give anything more than what my legs have to offer on that day.

In many ways, this race mirrored that of my 2011 NCAA XC race. I came in thinking top-15 was in the cards, only to find myself a bit further back and somewhat deflated. In 2011 I placed 25th. In 2015 I placed 24th. Both races I gave my all on that day, and in both races I was disappointed with the outcome after what I had thought was excellent preparation.

Now I find myself trying to push the 12k that was beat into me back out of my mind and thinking about the 5k. I'm hoping to find redemption on the track.

EDIT: I just found my splits on the results. Boy do they suck. I really sandbagged the 4th and 5th laps. 6:48/2k = 5:28/mi. WTF was I doing?"

Strugglebus just to finish the run. Probably got overzealous this week with mileage. Run a big race at altitude with a lot of effort, then bump up my mileage the next week to the highest level in about 6 weeks? Idiot.

Earlier start to the day since after this workout I jumped in my car and drove to Salt Lake City to go visit Tommy.

Workout went alright, but not great. Coming into it, my legs were a little tired and so I didn't have the spring that would have been nice for a VO2max session. Apparently altitude makes a difference of ~5-6 seconds on each one of these, but that seems like a generous conversion to me.

Each one hurt about the same, meaning that when I first started I was already a bit in the hole. Oh well, this is my first true VO2max session in a while with reps over 400m, so I could just be busting the rust off."

Considering the conditions (~20�, light snow and wind, 5400ft), I'm feeling pretty good about this workout. Yeah, the rest was a bit long, but that'll come down as I get to sea level and also have a few more of these sessions in my legs to be moving more comfortably at this speed.

Tried to hit 60s, but it just wasn't quite in the cards today. On reps 5 and 6, a bunch of frickin' geese landed on the track and decided lane 1 was the cool place to hang out since I had shoveled it, so I had to run them off (literally) in the last 70 meters.

Felt pretty solid on these. 7-9 were tough, but that's the portion of the workout that's always tough, so time to just sack up. Felt like I was right at the threshold line, so I'm happy with this morning's effort. Time to cram nutrition and recover for this afternoon."

Best long run...well, ever. The streak of great runs continues. I mentioned to Dennis this week that I am a little apprehensive about feeling too good too soon since my last two weeks of workouts has been the best of my life. He acknowledged that things were going really well and wanted to keep up with the threshold/sub-LT stuff and probably scale back to only a single anaerobic effort in a week to make sure I'm not too hot too soon.

So today's run, in my mind, just served as a good bit of evidence of my increasing fitness as I continue to keep my base up a few weeks out from the beginning of the track season. My plan is to race well all the way to August, so I need to keep my miles up to be able to sustain that sort of longevity.

Easy solo jaunt. Right achilles and right hammy lit up just a little bit. Not even mood level lighting though--more like 10% or less on a dimmer switch. 

Point being that I'm going to play it safe this week since my last two weeks have been the best of my life. Cutting out doubles to bring the mileage down and let my body absorb all this training. 

I fought back and forth with myself during this run about whether I should come down or not this week, seeing that the first 5k is two weeks away, but then in the end, the thought of 'simply be consistent' won out and I decided it is in my best long term interest to come down a bit this week and absorb everything I've done the last few."

Was a little skeptical about how my achilles would feel for this since it has gotten a little tender since the long run, but it didn't bother me at all during the workout. Felt tender on the cooldown, but didn't bother me too much (3/10).

Feeling really good about this workout. Found myself having to pull back a bit on reps 9-12 at the 300 mark to keep from getting overly greedy. Mostly happy with how the workout felt. Breathing was a lot harder than I had anticipated, but this is definitely the best quarter reps workout I've ever had.

Just need to keep this achilles situation under control.

Got treatment with Sam following the run and had him focus on the calf and achilles. DBark is thinking a double aerobic effort on Friday, pending the achilles situation. Just trying not to get greedy. Will plan to go pretty light tomorrow."

Started later in the day to try and let my achilles warm up for the day, but it didn't do a ton of good. Felt fine starting out, but then about a 1/2 mile in, it started getting a bit tender, and then got a little worse as I finished. Cut it short and playing it safe. My best guess is that it's still flared up from the work I got done on it yesterday, as Sam was pretty aggressive with graston.

Will likely take the next few days off to try and nip this thing in the bud. I honestly feel like I'm in 13:25ish 5k shape and I just don't want to screw it up. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."

Thought about going to Lifetime for an hour and doing the average Joe gym thing: get on the reclining bike for 15 minutes and read People Magazine to work up a good 'sweat', then head over to the kettle bell area and do a few snatches--really hit it hard when the ladies are watching. Try to catch an eye or two. Maybe even work up the gusto to talk to one. 

Spend the next 20 minutes getting on a good stretch because I'm so tight from all the heavy lifting I was doing, then hit the automatic massage chair in front of the tube for a little relaxation sesh before a hot shower and heading home.

Easy solo jaunt through an ambush of spring snow that fell overnight. But most importantly, my achilles felt great! No pain or tenderness. My right calf fatigued a little faster than my left did, but I'm guessing it's the result of me mushing the crap out of it the past few days with a trigger point ball trying to get the thing to loosen up.

Bit of a different start to the day, as my friends Ryan and Caleb came over to shoot a short film about my running and all. So we did a little interview thing, and then got going for the run. As I ran around Isles, they took a bunch of footage and I stopped/started a few times for some shots. Ended up doing two loops around Isles and on the second loop they finished filming and I got to do a little prescribed baby workout. Talked about my motivation to run and it primarily came down to 1) not wanting to look like Collmar, 2) trying to be fast enough for speed goggles to steal Ricky Lupp back from Abigail, and 3) not wanting to enter 'real life' and work 40+ hours a week at a desk.

So I ended up doing a mile warmup, 3 miles @ sub-LT, then finished with 3 x 4 minutes @ LT with 90s rest, then jogged back home. Legs felt heavy, which is no surprise looking back on the last 5 days. But the really good news is that my achilles felt great and I had no problems. Still very pleased that I had the patience to take those days off. I hope now that it's behind me.

Decided to give this workout a go after my achilles warmed up the first mile and felt pretty good. Had some worries about it being able to handle the impact loading this workout demanded, but it actually dealt with it pretty well during the workout.

Felt sore on the cooldown though and has me a bit worried. We'll see how I feel tomorrow.

In terms of the workout though, objectively it was very good. One of the better workouts of my life. It didn't feel as comfortable as I would have liked it to, but that's understandable given what's transpired the last week with my achilles."

Achilles was feeling good, so I jumped on the treadmill to test it out and made it 3 miles before calling it a day. Could have gone further, but achilles was starting to get a bit aggravated, so I called it.

Then jumped in the pool for a paltry 25 minutes because I hate swimming.

Here's the plan moving forward:
Seeing Craig at TCO for a PT appointment today. Since I had an inflammatory response after the workout on Thursday, our best guess is that perhaps it's some fluid caught between the sheath of the tendon and the tendon itself (an edema), so we're going to try zapping it with some dex via ionto. Hoping that will help move things along."

Got to run outside again today, which was pretty awesome. Achilles felt similar to yesterday: great for the first two miles, then started to get tender around 3, but then it actually started to feel better at 4 miles until the end. But unlike yesterday, it was a little painful doing LRMs and eccentric work after the run. Not sure what to make of it.

I guess I'll plan to do the same number of miles tomorrow and then compare the two days to see if I'm improving or not. It'll give me a better sense of if my light jogs are beneficial or detrimental to my recovery."

Got in the pool at did 3 sets of my normal pool routine to get 63 minutes of cardio in, then did some core after. 

Thinking about things that can help prevent achilles issues in the future. Perhaps wear spikes less often and it could be beneficial to reincorporate an actual weight routine. I do the isos and plyos, but that may not be enough. When doing even light strength training in college, I rarely had this kind of issues."
04/03/2015,12:00 PM,Cross Training,Normal,0.00,miles,0,,,,,,pound,,,,,F,,,"Lifetime Fitness - 8:00am

Did my thing in the pool again, followed by core. Want to shoot myself already after 2 days in the pool. It does get up my heart rate pretty well, and the kicking routine I do does stimulate the leg muscles in a pretty similar way to running. When I'm finished, both my quads and hammys are sore.

On another note, thanks to Corey's (cmclogan55) note on my log, <a href='http://running.competitor.com/2014/12/injury-prevention/new-exercises-fixing-achilles-injuries_119928'><b>I read this article</b></a>, which was probably the most informative and helpful article I've read thus far on achilles injuries in runners. 

As a result, I think I have paratenonitis. All of my symptoms are those identified in the article, and it also explains why I've been up and down so much with it (feeling good, to running and feeling bad, then back to feeling good so fast). The paratenon receives plenty of bloodflow, so it can heal quickly, but I was only taking 3 days off a time, rather than the 10 that is prescribed in the article. So now that I think this is what I'm dealing with, I'm planning for a 10 day recovery stint and hopefully that will be enough to get me back on my feet."

I'm not sure if that's the best way to describe it, but it just felt unreliable at certain points. I couldn't just enjoy the run, I just kept thinking about my achilles and wondering if it was going to start hurting again."

Solo jaunt. Feeling like a runner again. Got to Calhoun and some dude was (in)conveniently running about 6:15 pace heel striking like there was no tomorrow. Of course I couldn't let this dude roll me, so I dropped 6 flats for 1.5 miles before turning off and heading home. Actually felt pretty good to pick it up and the achilles handled the pace just fine."

Solo trot. First 1/4 mile was at 10:30 pace. My quads were so sore from lifting I felt like I was shuffling.

On the slight downhill connector between Harriet and Calhoun, I actually thought my legs were going to buckle under me and I would faceplant on the path."

Cold and windy again back in MSP. Thoughts of springtime and the 70� weather on Saturday were swept away by 20mph winds and 30� temps.

Quads still sore like there's no tomorrow, but other than that, it felt good to pick it up again. Didn't feel too strained. My breathing was pretty labored, but legs mostly felt fine (again, minus the quads).

Just hope to come out of this feeling good with the achilles. If so, then perhaps workout on Wednesday, and just maybe a 1500 on Saturday. Maybe."

50 minutes on the spin bike. Easy double on deck for this afternoon. Just trying to keep time on my feet low with a recovering achilles but heart rate high.

It dawned on me on the way home that I bike to the gym, to get on a bike, and then bike home.
That would be like running to the gym, to jump on a treadmill, and then run home."

22� with 15mph constant winds gusting up to 30mph. Still haven't come up with an answer why I live in Minnesota.

This was discouraging. I know the conditions sucked majorly and it was my first VO2max workout back, but come on. I ran faster workouts than this in high school.

Need to keep gritting it out."

A peaceful morning run. I needed this. Feel like things are starting to come back together. Just hope my achilles holds up for the workout tomorrow--it has been feeling good thus far.

Also, a shameless plug: I have some incredibly talented friends who made a really neat video about my running. <a href='https://vimeo.com/movingedgemedia/review/125816946/4988c608e8'><b>Check it out here.</b></a>"

Left Alpha at my church a bit early to squeeze this in before heading down to Mankato with Dani to see her sister perform.

A big improvement over Wednesday's session. It was tough and my legs were feeling like a big tubes of gelatin at the end, but this was overall a much better experience than my previous session. Achilles seemed to handle the workload fine with no soreness on the cooldown."

I've been putting off logging this just because I'm trying to digest what it means. It was frustrating and disappointing. Albeit a step in the right direction, and I should focus on the progress, it's difficult to reconcile that with the knowledge of having the ability to do 4 of these with 1 minute rest a mere month ago.

It was hard and it sucked, but DBark just wanted to do one mile hard. He's hoping that will help make this weekend feel easier. I hope so too."

Dogsitting for my buddy, so I ran for the first time ever with a dog. He was a husky and was rearing to go the first mile. Then we got into a pretty decent rhythm where we both were at the same pace. We only clotheslined a tree once, bringing both of us to a slinging halt.

He started being a bum around 6 and I had to keep tugging him to get him home."

Ran with the husky again and today he must have been sore from yesterday. Started bumming it around 3 miles and I had to tug him like a waterskier behind a boat. The only time he would speed up is to show off when other dogs were around, and then he would go back to being a slacker."

Pretty much what I expected coming into the race. I figured it would be a bad day if I was over 14, and a pretty decent one if I was under 13:50. So I was smack in the middle of that. 

Last mile sucked a fatty: my penultimate lap was 70. Woof.

Guess I'm still crying over spilled milk here, but it just sucks to have been in way better shape than this, then get hurt, and then come out here and do this. I dunno. It was a step in the right direction, but I'm frustrated. I'm 0/2 on coming into track season healthy under Dennis."

Easy long run with MP, JP, Jon Seas, and Jamie Cheever. Well, easy in pace, but not in effort. At one point we had a 3 mile climb up some 1,500 ft or so. It was ridiculous. Some awesome view was supposed to be at the top, but we never saw it. The park was gorgeous anyway with redwoods everywhere.

Right achilles bothered me after about 2 miles. Just aggravated. Didn't get any worse, but didn't improve. Thinking it's because I raced in spikes last night."

DBark wanted me to do some 200s, but with how my achilles is feeling, I just didn't think it was the best idea. Achilles is improving, but I don't have the confidence back yet that it could handle some intensity and be able to come out of it ok.

Decided against running the TC1 today. Just feel like this year is slipping through my hands and it sucks. I worked so hard over the winter and now I'm watching the season go by from the sidelines."

Decided to hit the AlterG after discussing with DBark and it felt alright, but not great to be honest. Achilles felt worse than yesterday just running on solid ground. I really think the plyos were just too much.
